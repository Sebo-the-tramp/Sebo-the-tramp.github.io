Welcome to my website! I am Sebastian Cavada, a dedicated Computer Science graduate from the Free University Bolzano, where I earned my Bachelor's degree with distinction. My bachelor's thesis, supervised by Prof. Oswald Lanz, explored topics in 3D pose estimation from video streams. Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Research in Computer Vision at MBZUAI in Abu Dhabi, specializing in 3D Gaussian splatting under the guidance of Prof. Ian Reid. My academic journey includes an enriching Erasmus experience in Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabrück, where I focused on Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I am passionate about advancing computer vision technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. 🚀

<!-- ### Hackathons and Competitions:
I thrive in collaborative environments, which is why I frequently participate in hackathons. One highlight was HackZurich, Europe’s largest hackathon, where my team developed “Out of the Blue,” a tool transforming 2D blueprints into detailed 4D models. This project not only showcased our technical skills but also emphasized our ability to innovate under pressure. Another significant event was the Pioneers 4.0 Hackathon in the UAE, where my team created an optimization solution for tea production, winning first place and securing an internship with LIPTON tea. 🌍✨

<!-- I am a Junior Developer and Innovation Enthusiast with experience in the technology industry. I worked last year as the CTO of RealverseVR, a start-up focused on creating educational experiences through virtual and augmented reality. I also previously worked as a sales staff for La Sportiva, a company that produces and develops mountaineering equipment, and completed internships as a Junior Developer for Suggesto and as an IT-component repair technician for RepairMy. 

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the Free University of Bolzano, where I was also a student representative for 2 years. I also studied Cognitive Science as part of an Erasmus program at the University of Osnabrück and has completed secondary education in both Italy and Ireland. I received several awards for my work in hackathons and was a finalist for Italian Climate Launchpad and Productflows as part of my passion for enterpreneurship.  -->
