# Speed

This is an idea that I had in mind for a while. When we ask people what is the most important thing that we have, they most likely will answer you, that is time. It is (together with space) the only thing that is fully limited in this life. We live in a 4 dimensional reality where space is theoretically unbounded, and even if it physically has boundary, with all the time that we have left as a single person, we might never reach the end of space. Thus logically the only thing which is limited theoretically with a strong and unmovable upper bound is time. 

So how do we deal with that? If you ask people a little more intelligent that me and of the average I would say that they tell you: "Well, time is not really the most precious currency, attention is!". And they would be right as well. Where we direct our time and how we spend our currency is indeed more important. The way we spend our days, what we do in the morning, our routines, activities, largely define our quality of life, and ultimately our satisfaction.

But can we go even further? Is there something even more importan than attention? Ineed I found an answer to this. And, I have yet to hear someone say, it is the decision that we make. They can compound our attention and thus multiply our time. Or they can lead us down the wrong path for which we'll have to pay more attention and more time later to be able to even get back at our initial (most likely sub-optimal) state to then take the opposite decision or another and hope that this time will be different. This has been the case for me as well as for many other people I think. But I have never thought or heard that you should put a lot of weight on your decisions. Early career moves, the person you are partnering up with, the project you start on the side, the people that you accept in your life. Your standard are a decision, most of the times only passively taken or even worst not even considered.

Then what's next. Well here it becomes a little bit more hectic and very high level. Indeed though I think is your vision. What do you expect out of your life. Why people with a clear mission, clear goal are more likely to achieve what they want and be succesfull? Because they can measure their progress against a metric, which is the distance to their goal. And this is exactly where I'll leave this though. 

There is no blogpost that will save you, and turn your life around, but you choosing what is your meaning and your vision. You shall go all-in in one thing, make it your life-goal. Once you are aligned, there is no money that matter, time will disappear and blend with reality, attention will be channeled into the only 1 thing you can see, decisions will be brainless and you, by moving towards your target will be happy and fulfilled, no matter if you will hit the target or miss it by an inch.

As Nietzsche would put it:

I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and the impossible.
