# The crash after the climb

The Climb has been mostly done. As I am writing now, I am waiting to present my thesis in front of my judges next week. Now I feel unmotivated, tired, my mind is completely foggy I don't really know what is going on. I fear I am lazy, but the reality probably is that my body is trying to somehow recover from everything that has been going on in the past months. In particular it's trying to process the last bits of the breakup, the time I sacrificed thinking and writing and so on and lastly what is my next chapter going to look like.
