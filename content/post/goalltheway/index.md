I just came across a video from Lex Fridman about this poem. He was reciting it with a lot of emphasis and emotions. I remembered I wrote a thought about it long ago,
it was the 13th of April 2020. 

And I think I was already very attentive.


## The thought of 3 years ago

This poem, this single idea shaped some moments of my life. It has some deep meaning. There are no good words to describe it. Each I will add here will just take away its significance.

{{< quote author="Charles Bukowski" source="Go all the way">}}

If you’re going to try, go all the way.

Otherwise, don’t even start. 

This could mean losing girlfriends, 

wives, 

relatives 

and maybe even your mind. 

It could mean not eating for three or four days. 

It could mean freezing on a park bench. 

It could mean jail. 

It could mean derision. 

It could mean mockery 

isolation.
 
Isolation is the gift. 

All the others are a test of your endurance,

of how much you really want to do it. 

And, you’ll do it, 

despite rejection and the worst odds. 

And it will be better than anything else you can imagine. 

If you’re going to try, go all the way. 

There is no other feeling like that. 

You will be alone with the gods, 

and the nights will flame with fire. 

You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. 

It’s the only good fight there is.

## The thought of today

My ideas and concepts didn't change much, but they did change a lot. Nevertheless this poems, this idea, this life style is still with me. When I think about it I think about all the projects I started and that I didn't finish. They weren't meant to be started at all. The few that I felt are worth my time and resources, are the ones that I want to pursue. 

If there is **one thing** I learned in the last couple month is that life is **limited**. Therefore we need to choose not many thing, the one we are passionate, the ones that stay and the one that makes us the most curious and **go all the way** in them. We cannot make progress in 100 different directions, we won't move. But rather we shall put most of our efforts into 1 or at max a couple of goals and give it all.

Every time I listen to this arrangement of words, I get different feelings and each time with different levels of abstraction I gain different insights.

In conclusion in this moment of my life, this gives me hope that what I am doing is right and gives me a direction and a feeling of happiness.

##### I will go all the way
