# Free thoughts

You know I am here in my lab, this time alone. Listening to a beautiful song: "Brividi". It really makes me think. I am watching, and also there is the pianist,
in the background that wasn't given flower. That was a bit sad.

Anyway the thought I had was about me and some choices of me not to watch San Remo and not being interested in this at all. This strong repulsion for this kind of stuff.
What I always thought is, if there are so many people watching this, why am I different than the average in doing so. That scared me. 
But maybe given that we are human, the music stays with us independently of how successful we are. The art and the poems and the songs, are for every heart
essentials.\
They are life.\
What also I don't like as well is the fact of how they handled some political questions. Last year with the "green carpet" of Eni and this year with the 
political side of the war, inviting Zelensky.\
It is very difficult for me to grasp this concepts. \
And that is why I am trying to push my self.

There are better songs and worst ones. But the joy of being there and feeling part of something is cool.\
It does have to give and I can get so much from this situation.\
Probably I can notice only know how much I hurt the feelings of some people saying this or that is a waste of time, just thinking that I am the only source of truth.
Because that has happened many times, and I can feel it happening again some times. The fact that I realized such an important insight, is very impactful on my life.
It did change a lot. It did put my heart in peace, with others and with the world. That doesn't mean I do not have values or standards or ideas. But the acknowledgement
that everyone has them is surely the first step to a healthier life, as well as relationship wise with other people.
Is cool I don't get much thoughts of this genre, but I like to write them down. Usually I do write on my diary, but this one felt easier to write on the keyboard.
And then it is only a "flusso di pensieri" probably translated to thought flux or something like that.

Anyway the concept here is that everyone is different and everyone has his desires and passions and fears. And what I di in the past, was to joke around and not really 
be genuinely interested in this. Only thinking for myself. That was a big mistake. It is wise to think of others as other selves, with all the good and bad that comes.
With all the fears and insecurities that everyone has. With the joy and shame. \
There was a part in the show that I firstly reacted in a negative way but only know writing these lines I found so profound and genuine. I was always saying stuff, 
attacking and not enjoying and trying to understand what people are. 
And then there was Chiara Ferragni. A super entrepreneur, millions of followers, millions in the bank. A super life. And there she was with an emotion that everyone would
feel in her shoes. She was agitated/restless/stirred I don't know exactly the adjective. But she showed so much humanity in her smile and eyes. That really got me thinking 
about how much we need to become humans again to each other. In every way possible. 

From a gentle gesture and words to a younger sibling, or to a smile to an old lady. That might be the very beginning of something special.

But there I am only capable of writing and who knows if I can put into practice what I think. It is not easy, it is hard.

But I will try my best, and again and again.
