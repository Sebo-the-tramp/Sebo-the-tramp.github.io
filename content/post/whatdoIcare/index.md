# What do I care about?

After waking up again at 4.30, and not being able to fall asleep again, I went to my lab as usual and watched some reels. Luckily my reels really push me 
to do better. And I saw this video of a guy that asked what do I value, and if what I value will make me better of one day. And that struck me.
Again I do not have a claer answer to that question. But I know a couple of things.

## What I do not care about

## Myself 

Recently I really learned to care for myself. When there is a good thing happening, my life is better. I am the mind that lives in this body and I have to care for my body and mind for them to work good together so to keep me healty, motivated and also happy.

## My brother

It wasn't always like that, but also recently I valued how much I do care for my brother. How he was able to push me forward, make me grow, and we do crazy shit together. This is something I love. And that is why I really come to an end that I can say I care deeply about him.

## My friend Giulia

She was my first girflriend. We grow a lot together. We went through a rough time, decisions and process. We are still kind of there. I have realized how much I cared about her, and now as (11/03/2023) we are still trying to figure out things. As of today (9/12/2024), after close to 1.5 years together she left me.
Probably forever and for good. I was not the best boyfriend, distant, emotionally detach and trying to prove something to myself so much, I detached from reality. And she found a new person which might treat her better than I could. I am sorry, but I couldn't see this before. It might even be a fucking gift though.
In the end life comes from within.

You know as of end of 2025. I see the struggle of you looking back. But that has been the best thing that could have appened to you by far. The new experiences the new people I met along the way that I might not have met otherwise, and the things I learned. Made me so much better, and I realize how bad she was for me, not because she is inherently bad, but because the things she's after are definitely not the ones I am after. And I have found that with some people (very few) you can actually vibe so well and so mcuh without many compromises and stuff you like exactly the same things and the other person knows what you are going through because she is close to that and then you just keep moving together, trying to grow together, she didn't want to grow. At all. And definitely not in my direction, maybe the only thing she wanted to grow was her body count idk, to me is much more profound, a spiritual journey, like the hero's journey. So that was the first obstacle I was able to overcome. I had bad feelings toward her for long time, nowadays I can tell myself that I have no thing. She's just dead for me. She is exactly as before I met her, with the small difference that there are neurons in my brain that remind of her. Nevertheless I was able to make peace with myself for the bad things she did to me. And that is all that matters.
