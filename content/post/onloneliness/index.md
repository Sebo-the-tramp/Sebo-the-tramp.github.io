# On loneliness

During many arguments that I am having with my best friend, it went a bit aggressive and she asked me, do you know how to be lonely, are you ok being alone with yourself? At first my reaction was not knowing how to respond, because I never thought about it. 
From there on I long tail of thoughts was born. First I would attack her because she said that, and I thought she couldn't stay lonely too, followings many arguments she said. Than the thought that what she was speaking about was wrong given the fact that the same day she took a day off from her vegetarian ethics and bought a leather pair of shoes. And it went on for a while trying not to put it on myself. Then, something happened, and I asked myself. What if she's right.

What if I cannot stay alone. What if I need someone to be with me. It can be found in many songs of mine, in many poems etc... It was the main source of insecurity for
me and not being able to stay peaceful and calm. Always trying to have someone in my loneliness. I though, I wrote, I basically did a complete scan of my thoughts and my brain at that moment. It wasn't attacking anybody, it was analysing my thoughts. I also overcome one of my biggest fears. I really observed all the situation from far away and wrote down any single thing even if it hurt. I faced everything.

I understood so many things. 

I cried and that revealed to me that I am not a robot. I am a human being. And I am a human being that do cares about this person profoundly and sincerely. I thought I might be pretending to some extent. I found out the answer.

## The most important part

At the beginning I agreed that I can't stay alone. Because I couldn't answer anything else. But later that evening in my bed, with my thoughts, with myself I reflected and I observed how much I can stay alone. How much I was alone the past 6 months. And how much I learned.

The list is long and I won't write it all down. But I will write down the most important things that I learned.

- I learned to be grateful
- I learned to care about myself
- I learned discipline
- I learned consistency
- I learned to put effort in my development and as a consequence like myself more
- I learned to understand myself and other people better
- I learned I do mistakes and I am not perfect, but that's what makes us human
- I found a friend and a shelter in my diary

I learned to be alone and that is all what I need in my life. Because that's with myself that I will have the most talks and it is with me that I have to live.
Nobody else but me will always be with me during my life. Friends, parents, girlfriends will come and go. But I will not.

## And now?

I am still lonely. I will still learn. But with a different struggle. Because I also learned that I have myself.

Maybe a difficult time is coming, maybe a good one instead. But ultimately is up to my mind and my reason to decide how I will react to it.
