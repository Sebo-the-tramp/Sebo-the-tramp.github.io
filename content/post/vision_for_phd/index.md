<!-- # Why a PhD?

Great question. Probably not the greatest of the answer. I have only recently considered a PhD journey. Not years ago, just couple of weeks ago. It started out of curiosity. It started when I asked myself "How can I give tangible value to the world, given what I have learned in my academic journey?". Surely an industry career might be valuable, but I would chose academia because of the exploratory endeavour that comes attached. The people working on the same problem, sharing the same road and struggle is what it makes it worth pursuing.
My master supervisor told me that he always asks what makes you go out of bed in the morning and go do research. It's another great question, to which I could not yet find a comparabely great answer. In short to me what lights me up is being able to work on difficult problems, with "cracked" people and enjoy the progress together. Being able to thinker about solutions, talk about big GPU clusters, advanced algorithms, big O notations and optimizing the processes, this is what makes the fire inside me burn. I know that most people like this are also pursuing a PhD especially in places like TUM, ETH, Tubingen and where not. I want to work with people and learn from them and hopefully share my knowledge, my passion and my motivation in the lab.  -->


<!-- ## What are the details of my interests

I have always been fascinated by cars in all their sense. So when I found out that you can even make cars drive on their own, I was drawn to it even more. Understanding the world and understanding how we also work is the ultimate search for me. Understanding how we interpret 3D space, how we perceive movement and direction. How we plan and react on unplanned events. This algorithms is a non-stop process in our brain and I am curious to see what I can contribute to it.

Practically my interest lies at the intersection fo 3D geometry and scene underrstanding/perception. I want to research a representation that can combine expressiveness of the world with uinterpretability and efficiency in mind. 
I have been working with 3D foundation models, mast3r and dust3r, which gave me an idea of the future direction but I feel there are still research gaps, especially on how we combine only the 3D informations and the informations from LLMs and act upon this common knowledge. There have been baby steps in this direction, but mostly are ad hoc, scenario constrained and computationally expensive. 

My interest is to develop efficient models that can understand the world from the ground up. Fully trained end-to-end, to not only unify the 3D tasks, but pave the way for a truly unified understanding of 3D, planning and reasoning. -->

# Why a PhD?

The decision to pursue a PhD came more recently than for most. It wasn’t the result of a long-held plan, but of a growing realization: that I find energy and meaning in difficult problems, in shared intellectual struggle, and in building systems that move us toward better understanding of the world.

My academic path gave me the tools—mathematics, geometry, machine learning—but it was during my Master’s thesis that I began to see research not just as technical work, but as a personal journey. Long hours of experimentation, debugging, reading papers, and discussing failure cases with peers taught me something deeper: that research is as much about *process* and *people* as it is about results.

What drives me is not just the pursuit of answers, but the environments where questions are alive. I want to be part of labs where curiosity is shared, where hard problems are met with collaboration, and where knowledge is treated not as a competition, but a conversation.

# Research Interests

My interest lies at the intersection of **3D geometry**, **scene understanding**, and **representation learning**. I’m fascinated by how systems can learn to perceive space, reason about it, and ultimately *act* in it. I see this as a fundamental part of bridging perception and cognition, especially in autonomous systems and embodied agents.

Through my thesis, I worked with recent large-scale 3D foundation models like MASt3R and DUSt3R. These gave me a strong foundation in point-map prediction, camera-aware scene understanding, and hierarchical representations. I also explored neural rendering techniques such as Gaussian Splatting, where I observed both the potential and the bottlenecks of current methods—particularly in scalability, adaptability, and robustness.

Looking ahead, I am especially interested in the **fusion of 3D representations with language-based reasoning**, and in building models that can generalize across modalities while remaining interpretable and efficient. I believe this is a critical step toward building systems that can both *understand* and *communicate* complex spatial concepts.

I’m excited to explore architectures that move toward unifying 3D perception, planning, and reasoning—ideally in ways that are efficient enough for deployment beyond research settings.

# Why Now

This decision didn’t come from prestige or pressure. It came from a quiet, persistent voice saying: *you care about this*. I want to spend the next years not just writing code or reading papers, but participating in a community of people who are asking the same kinds of questions and pushing the boundaries of what we can build and understand.

A PhD, for me, is not just about specialization—it’s about alignment. Alignment with the kind of work I want to do, and the kind of person I want to become through it.

Thank you for considering my application.
