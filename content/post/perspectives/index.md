I guess I am loosing my ability to write thanks to ChatGPT. Luckily Italy is among the chosen ones. We have Pasquale, that means I have to write with my own birlliant natural language processor. I like to write. I do more often than I used to. Usually I didn't have much to write but today and this days I have been thinking about some ideas. 
I want this blog to be an open book and a place where I can write, change my mind and rethink much of my ethics.

## Contexts
An event in a town my home is called "Contesti". In Italian it means within contexts. Also it can be arranged to sound like with - texts or "con texts" taken literaly. It was about books. And a vision for the future of turiism in the valley. How unsustainable it has become, and how many bad things has been done by the governments.
Moreover, I have been changing a lot during the last 6 months. I have been writing as well this long. And a peculiarity has been following me since. My choices. I am a great observer, or at least I strive to be. My head choices were strange and many times counterproductive, maybe even cunterproductive sometimes. I have come to the realization not too much ago that all actions were the best I could have done in that **context**. Maybe not the best, I have to admit, but they were closely tailored to the context I was in.

## Explanations
I want to write here a great example I noted. My "girlfriend" and I have been reconciling for a while now. It is a process that began in late december. It had ups and downs, but the main point is that I asked her if she wanted to come to holiday with me and my family for eastern, where I am writing right now. The answer was negative, and I accepted the choice at that time even though I was sad about the choice. It wouldn't have been the first time she joined my family for holidays, so no big deal about being shy or similar emotions.

More than a month has gone by. I do now understand the context way better, and I can understand the way the decision was made by her. And what has been the emotions and thoughts involved. We were not close enough at that time. And that is fine. We have come long way since then. I have come a long way then.

## My parents
Many times and over again, I note things that my parents do or say that I much disagree with. Now I might still not agree and/or accept it but I have came to accept and deeply understand, maybe even internalize most of their argumentation.

## Meditation
It is not easy to understand the context. Shift prospectives. Walk in somebody else's shoes. It takes courage, energy, willpower and a strong mind to do so. I am still at my first steps in this. I succeded at beginning, I am hopeful that this is going to be the beginning of a nice journey of help and understanding.

## Conclusion
I think this is only the beginning of a wider stream of thoughts. I keep updating this and making improvements.
