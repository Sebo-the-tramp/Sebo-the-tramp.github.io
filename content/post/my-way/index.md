# Start from the end

There is this recurrent thought of mine, where I have to plan my life from the end. I am not going to change this thought for a while it seems to have helped me more than anything else.
Then scrolling through instagram, some days ago I encountered a video that wasn't just consuming content. It gave us to do some homework. I liked that type of interaction, so here I am. He might know or not but he changed some persons life :)

The homework was to give a detailed description of how I see myself living my life in 1, 5 and 20 years. In order to assets my view and create a plan and habits to reach that goal.

## In 1 Year time.

I would like to see myself enrolled in some university. I would love to be enrolled at the MBZUAI of Abu Dhabi. Studying computer vision and improve on my career in AI. I would be probably spending most time studying and creating projects, doing research and talking with others brilliant students. Probably in some dormitory. I would also be exploring as much as I can the cultore, the places and the ideas of this other country. I would like to still have the hunger of learning and trying new things as well as of improving myself. It is important for me to keep exercising and have reached about 70Kg of weight, and being fit and physically pleaseant.

I would like to have published my journal in some way either paper book or also in a digital format or blog. In maybe every day a new episode come out. The goal for that is helping other people given my story, and maybe make somebody else feel less lonely then they are now. 
I am not sure if that is important, but in a year I would have like to have more than 20k in my bank account.

I would have left the current "startup" in which I am "working". And I would like to keep up my youtube account, with projects and this website.
During the next semester I also would like to have done some internship and have developed new skills, such as of selling and marketing to some extent. 
In this side I like to keep up doing the "Birkengym" idea. Developing idea, creating content and being able to scale and grow in order to learn that part as well.
The climathon must have reached its second edition, with more than 50 participants and it has to be lovely.
In the next year I am going to try to, get back what I blindlessly lost, that added the most value to my life so far. The person that I thought I would have been living with for the rest of my life. It will difficoult, but I will never forgive myself if I didn't try hard enough. Then the result is outside of my will, but the time and willingness I am going to put in is going to be "all I can".

## In 5 Years
I would have liked to have found the person I will spend the rest of my life with.

I will have done my master. Maybe also a PhD, in some sort of AI part. 

I will have founded my first company, probably not in Italy. Either in AbuDabhi or Germany, or Ireland. I don't think I will move as far as America evn though there are good moneys there for AI startups. 
I would put forward the argument that I would have like to have made my first 100k. 

My physique should be as its peak and my knowledge and connections has to be the broader they are going to ever be.

The climathon should already at its 4-5 edition and the impact I brought into the climate change bereits has to be tangible and I would have to be confident in my actions and my potential. 

If I ever moved to AEU, I would like to have learned the arab language. And have visited the desert at least one. 

I also want to create a big network of people, that might enable me to make big things and with whom to do crazy stuff around the world.
Other than the company I would like to have founded, I would have had some experiences around the world, experiences of growth and to meet new friends and learn new stuff.


## In 20 Years
Somehow I think this is easier to write because I feel more free from the constraints of reality and time because in 20 years a looot of things can happen. I really can see myself wherever I like.

### More fantasy
I would like to have a wife, being married. Bought a house, you know the classic things, that make you feel good and accomplish. I would like to be able to think having some children, and being able to have solved any financial problems at that point. Maybe married from 10-5 years. I would have travelled the world. Done some sabbatics months. Wrote a couple of books, about self help and yes being free from any time constraints in order to grow and persue my other project. My children.

### Back to reality
I would surely have a company, that has to do with AI, research, physics, really anything in which I can learn and do math, computer every day. I would like this company to grow big and prosperous, because it where the new things are created.
I want it to be a big part of my life. I would like to be remebered as a person that gave mor than I took. That gave value to people, what value, the value of hard work, the value of the earth we are living on and the beauty of the research, friends and of being healty, and persuing something higher in life, something that will live on after we are not here anymore. 
Doing something that might allow every single human to have access ot the same resources, opportunities and ideas.
The goal for me is not to being rich, anything near that. Is literally giving value to others through my life. Being an example of doing good and being gentle. That is what I strive to be.

### About friends
I think I don't want to have too many friends, ahve a couple of good friends that really would follow me in war is what I really like. One of them is already my brother. I need to find other people such that will match my energy and being so crazy as me. Because if I had put this things into words, I have to be none other than crazy.

### My house
The house is the place where family is and where love is. I would live to still have a house in the place where I live now in Italy in Fiemme Valley. I would also like to have several houses around the world, but I feel it will also be more than I would want. Therefore I am still not sure about that.

### My work
I will always love the art of writing in the language of the machines, and I will hope I will still be able and have the priviledge to do so. My day to day, situation I would like to be is to do research find out new stuff, maybe also direct some research teams, and listen to them and make some progress. I would really like to be in the energy sector, in order to enable the advancement of human civilization here on earth and provide more clean sources of energy.

### My wife
The person I will be living the most of my time. It is very interesting question. Definitely I would like her to be very similar to me. Match my energy, have a passion for discover new things learn, but more than everything help and give value with ones life.
It has to be beautiful, not smoker, having a passion for sport and most of all self improvement.


## I can only add now - 2024
Reading back at the years from now it's crazy. It really shows me how far I have become. It shows my character my passion and my grit. This moment is a span of time where my grit is a bit loose. Everything seems to be with me one day, and the other day seems against me. I tend to focus on the negative side rather than what positive I have. Reading such thoughts of long ago gave me shiver and I think will help me to go trough now. 

If I would write this in 1 year I think is going to be very difficult as I am a bit pessimistic as of now, and still confused a lot.

1 Thing for sure is that I want to do an internship at NVIDIA or at some bigtech company and then enroll to a PhD in Zurich hopefully ETH. As I write this things I am aware of how much difficult this things are, therefore I want to underline that is mostly the moment, not the lack of security. It will change and I hope it will happen. I have a plan but I need again a pristine execution. Also the startup that we are building "Wellround" I don't know how much I will be able to carry on for as the CEO., that's what I feel I am now anyway. But I hope it will be striving and be something helpful to people. Exactly today we got vert good feedback from a professional which is big into this field which was really amazing to feel.
