To you,

you that are my first love, the person that made me grow out of my small world and showed me greatness. The person that thought me how to be me, and the person
that always pushed me to pursue my dreams. The only person that showed me unconditional love, other than my parents (and that could be also questioned).

I wrote a poem for you some time ago, I'll share it here:

Insegnamenti

Mi hai insegnato ad essere sciallo\
E volevo farti vedere che ogni tanto riuscivo

Mi hai insegnato la gentilezza\
E volevo farti vedere che avevo imparato

Mi hai insegnato ad apprezzarmi\
E volevo farti vedere che sono migliorato

Mi hai insegnato l’amore incondizionato\
Forse non lo ho meritato

E adesso soffro

Mi hai insegnato a vedere sempre il meglio\
E sono arrivato in ritardo a coglierlo in te

Mi hai insegnato a parlare con tutti\
E il mio castigo è non poter più con te

Mi hai insegnato l’importanza dei piccoli gesti\
E rimpiango di non averne fatti di più 

Mi hai insegnato la bellezza di vivere\
E adesso dovrò farlo senza di te

E adesso chissà

It's end of February 2023. We spent nearly 4 beautiful (is very far to reality though) years together. We had our highs and lows, we had our good times and we had our difficult times. I feel we are having such moment now. We nearly left this precious glimpse of spacetime be forever ruined. We somehow managed to save it, and we are still working on it. I'm sorry, deeply sorry, so deeply that this sorrow I never experienced before. 

### Draft 1 - 20/02/2023

We talked so much during this days and some of the result were that we still have to work on, but that you also want and have the curiosity to try new experiences with other persons. I had so much difficulty in understanding this, but somehow I was able to get my head around it. I feel that I am so deeply connected to you and I see so much potential in this relationship, that I am willing to accept such condition. Even if it hurts. Even if it is something I wouldn't do. I feel that is the only way to see you one day, besides me when we wake up for the rest of our days.

At this point in time, I feel I wasted much of an opportunity that was to spend my life with you. It was easy when we were together. It was peaceful, my mind was at ease, or at least is what I think it would have been. But I know that all these moments are going to eventually shape our relationship. And whatever is going to happen is going to be the product of all this ups and downs, combined with what we learn out of this and how we respond and act upon these answers.

I am hopeful that this is also part of our journey and that we will create amazing stuff together and do crazy shit together.

The photo in the cover has been taken the 10th of march 2018. The first day that I ever seen your face and I would never forget your beautiful smile.
