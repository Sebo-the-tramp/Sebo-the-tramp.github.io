# About Life

In a fragile moment of my life I want to start this "thread" or blog updates on what I think about life as a whole and what I want to pursue and that I find meaningful.

I was watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK6T1_RS6yY&ab_channel=KaizenMotivation) about motivation and staying disciplined, it's David Goggins talking and he tells that he needs to have a clear mind to get things done and staying consistent. Only then he can be active. I feel my mind is being cluttered with many stuff, that could be avoided and handled differently. One thing being the relationship that we are trying to address as of 20/02/2023.

I want to clear my mind here and give some thoughts I might have during the months and years about my journey in the spacetime of life.

## 20/02/2023

I am living the same moments that I was living some time ago. The stress and anxiety to make things right and trying to be perfect for a person. Wasting my time waiting for a message, wondering what is going on. Why there is no energy from the other side. Why is me that should give all the energy. That means it is not going the right direction. 
Aside from the moment that I am living now, I have come to think, then how should be such relations be handled. Maybe what I was used was too much, and the only healthy way to continue such relation is really giving us space. I'm struggling a lot lately on this. And that brings me to the main point of this thought which is how should the day go by, in a way that is both enjoyable, productive but at the same time worth a life. Maybe during the day, I should just focus on myself, work and other stuff and then when this first part being the priority is done then we can focus on just enjoying the rest.

Might you find the balance in a routine.

At the second point I would like to outline my thought of not being enough. At this point I have to confront myself with the thoughts of another person that she want to try out stuff with other people. That makes me feel that I am missing something, that there is something that I cannot give her. That makes me sad, because there is literally nothing I can do about it. That is what it is. And that makes me suffer. Being a person that is really into improving and being better, finding something for which there is nothing you can do to improve is super frustrating. I had some compliance with myself though. In this way since what she wants is out of my control, the only thing I can do is letting go and let this happen, even though with all the pain I will feel, with the insecurity that she might even come back, with the feeling of not being able to write a story together only for quite some time. But I might do condescend to this because it might be the only way to have the outcome that I might desire, to spend our life together. Either it goes this way or it wasn't meant to. I am afraid also to miss out a big chunk of the story if we don't push and work together towards a goal. That is very sad. My hearth cries.

Sometimes it is better to let go and, if it is meant to be, it will come back.

What is going through life without posing questions, taking positions and act according to some ethics? Madness?
