# HackUPC

After every hackathon I hit a local Low. It's a common thing for me. Maybe it's sleep deprivation, maybe is the dopamine miss, that happens when I don't win. Maybe is the huge amount of hours that I put into a project that I might not see again.
It's like the people that you meet sometimes, and might not see them again. That hurts. You want to know them a little bit more, share some thoughts, share some life, but then you end up strangers again.
I think this is the pain of falling in love. This is the pain of being profound, to give a fuck about some people that I guess do not reciprocate. 

Some times I feel that I don't want to connect anymore, because I guess, what will it be of this in few weeks you know. Maybe this is too much, and I should be more open, and not think it too much.

But what to do.

I don't know. 

I am sleep deprived and need to sleep.

Boh.
