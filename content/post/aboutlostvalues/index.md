# Why

Well I didn't meant to write such a thought, but it was the task for an English exam I am taking. It turned out better than I thought, and it also helped me to put 
my thoughts on the paper.


## Old fashioned values

Today we live in a world of social media, photos and videos, where real uman contact is **gradually being lost** as new social media platforms **emerge**. In such scenario, it is easier to show the world material possessions and/or social status through parties, fake friends, happiness, holidays and meaningless experiences.
Old-fashioned values are slowly fading because they are old. But mostly because they are difficult to achieve, they require consistency, they are becoming a niche for a small group of people. People who try to live up to the standard of a good human being. Not showing off to gain social status or momentum, but remaining humble and improving themselves just for themselves. So it is very rare to find such individuals, but they do exist and they are valued more because of their rarity.
Secondly, at the moment the young generation has got used to the mindset of “having everything at all times” but this does not apply to values such as kindness and trust. Trust is a precious currency and it takes time effort and sacrifice to earn it. But many young people do not understand this or do not want to understand. Many studies and my own experiences show that it takes longer to build up trust than it does to break it. But most of us still say the opposite, that everything can come as fast as it goes. But everything that comes quickly also goes quickly.
