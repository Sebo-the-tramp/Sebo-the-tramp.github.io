# Why difficult stuff?

It has been a while since I last wrote on this blog. I am not sure I will publish this anytime soon, but it's worth writing. I joined MBZUAI last year in August 2023. It has been a though semester, with many projects, team work and partial delusions as well.
This path I choose it was indeed the less easy one. And I am proud to have done this choice. The environment here is so challenging and have a lot of potential for growth for everyone. When I first arrived here I felt like I was a bit an outsider, considering how
expert and competent other people where. That was the first problematic part, acknowledge that I need to start from the bottom and slowly crowl up the summit. I thought I had good experiences and knowledge I could share, I was wrong. This shift in prespective led me to try to learn 
as much as I can from everyone around and trying to be humble but challenged as well.
From this I was able to get challenged as much that I feel I am learning to one day be able to contribute to something tangible in the field. 

This is the first difficulty that I was able to observe throughout the semester. In other words what I am experiencing now is a second order difficulty. Let me explain.

## First order difficulty
I did quite a few things that were difficult, but didn't require any special preparation. Most of the difficult things I did, related to sport, or accademic where related to the first order difficulty. You do something difficult and in a short time you are done with it. It is difficult but 
the results are immediate or at least short term. Cold showers, running, studying for an exam, etc. are all first order difficulties.

## Second order difficulty
This type of difficulty I am only experiencing recently, and it's the real difficult situation. It's the opposite of the first order difficulty. It's the difficulty that requires a lot of patience and resilience. It doesn't show you any immediate results. You need to commit for the longest period of
time. It requires you to be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, even if it's not there. Studying for a degree, learning a new language, learning a new skill, etc. are all second order difficulties. 
Here in this university I am experiencing multiple of this difficult situations: learning a new way of proposing ideas through papers and research, learning a new way of thinking and approaching problems. Doing research in different contexts and with different people that I am not sure where this will lead me. Furthermore the more physical aspect I am also training for a marathon. This is also second order difficulty. I need to train every day, eat well every day, sleep well every day, and I will only see the results in couple of months.

## Conclusion

This was just a reminder to myself of how things might be depicted as difficult, but not all have the same difficulty, and even if we could plot the difficulty level on a graph, two different graphs would be needed for the first and second order difficulties.

Let me know what you think and if you have any thoughts on this topic.
