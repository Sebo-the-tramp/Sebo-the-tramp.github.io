# The future

I think that there are 2 main things that will get as big as one can not even imagine.
AI and Longevity.

On one side the GPUs and whatever the fuck we are going to build next will allow for faster and better symbol manipulation that at some point will create new knowledge, new informations and so on. That is where we are headed. On the same idea, we will become so much faster in doing things and writing and creating that we will actually understand the value of being fast. Not inaccurate but learn faster and better. Find the best ways to learn and understand. 
We'll figure out that if we can save 5 seconds each time we have to copy paste something is going to be amazing. Time is the currency of the world, not money. Money can be created, more time cannot. We all have 24 hours a day.

And here is where longevity will come into place. Yes we all have the same 24 hours a day BUT some people live until 50, others until 80 etc. that means the latter have 24\*30\*365 more hours than the person who lived until 50. And bear with me, considering the conditions of life to be the same. That’s millions of extra minutes. 

So if you save 5 seconds every copy-paste you gained 5 seconds, and this is why with AI and integration of all tools we will strive to get this precious 5 seconds back. The winners will be the ones who build tools that make us more productive (think Cursor vs. VSCode). The others? The ones who figure out how to give us more time—real, functional, healthy time. Not extra years where you’re too old to move, but years where you’re sharp, fit, alive. We will not measure lifespan anymore, but healthspan.

Short term, maybe this doesn’t change much. But long term? The five seconds we save today might turn into something much bigger. Either we’ll look back and realize we saved weeks of our lives, or we’ll find entirely new ways to cut down wasted time by orders of magnitude.
And whatever we do now to live longer and healthier might give us 1 or 2 more year, but in the future who know what crazy methods that will enlong our healthspan by 10-20 years!

Once people realize this, we might actually be on the brink of something huge, and **I want to be there.**

<!-- I believe two major forces will shape the future in ways we can barely imagine: AI and longevity. These two domains have the potential to redefine how we live, work, and think.

On one hand, advancements in computing power—whether through GPUs or whatever revolutionary technology comes next—will enable faster and more sophisticated manipulation of information. This will lead to the creation of new knowledge, insights, and innovations at an unprecedented pace. As we become more efficient at processing and generating ideas, we’ll also discover better ways to learn and understand. Speed will become a critical asset, not just for doing things faster but for learning and adapting more effectively. Every second saved—whether it’s shaving five seconds off a repetitive task like copy-pasting or streamlining complex workflows—will compound into significant gains over time. Time, after all, is the ultimate currency. Unlike money, which can be created, time is finite. We all have 24 hours in a day, but how we use those hours will determine our success.

This is where longevity comes into play. While everyone has the same 24 hours daily, not everyone has the same number of years. Some people live to 50, others to 80 or beyond. That difference translates to decades of additional time—time to create, learn, and contribute. And if we can extend not just lifespan but healthspan—ensuring those extra years are spent in good health, with a sharp mind and an active body—the impact could be transformative.

In the short term, saving five seconds here or gaining a year there might seem trivial. But over the long term, these small efficiencies and extensions compound. Five seconds saved on a task could turn into weeks or even months of reclaimed time over a lifetime. Similarly, an extra year of healthy life could snowball into decades of additional productivity and fulfillment.

The winners of the future will be those who master these two domains. On one side, it will be the individuals or companies that create tools to maximize productivity—tools that help us work smarter, faster, and more effectively (think of the competition between Cursor and VSCode). On the other side, it will be those who unlock the secrets of longevity, enabling people to live longer, healthier, and more vibrant lives.

Once society fully grasps the potential of these two forces, we could be on the brink of something extraordinary. And I want to be there to see it—and be part of it. -->
