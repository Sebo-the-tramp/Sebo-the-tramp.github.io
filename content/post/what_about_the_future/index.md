# The future

I think that there are 2 main things that will get as big as one can not even imagine.
AI and Longevity.

On one side the GPUs and whatever the fuck we are going to build next will allow for faster and better symbol manipulation that at some point will create new knowledge, new informations and so on. That is where we are headed. On the same idea, we will become so much faster in doing things and writing and creating that we will actually understand the value of being fast. Not inaccurate but learn faster and better. Find the best ways to learn and understand. 
We'll figure out that if we can save 5 seconds each time we have to copy paste something is going to be amazing. Time is the currency of the world, not money. Money can be created, more time cannot. We all have 24 hours a day.

And here is where longevity will come into place. Yes we all have the same 24 hours a day BUT some people live until 50, others until 80 etc. that means the latter have 24*30*365 more hours than the person who lived until 50. And bear with me, considering the conditions of life to be the same. That’s millions of extra minutes. 

So if you save 5 seconds every copy-paste you gained 5 seconds, and this is why with AI and integration of all tools we will strive to get this precious 5 seconds back. The winner will be the person that can provide a tool to be more productive than others (see cursor vs VSCode).

The winners will be the ones who build tools that make us more productive (think Cursor vs. VSCode). The others? The ones who figure out how to give us more time—real, functional, healthy time. Not extra years where you’re too old to move, but years where you’re sharp, fit, alive. We will not measure lifespan anymore, but healthspan.

Short term, maybe this doesn’t change much. But long term? The five seconds we save today might turn into something much bigger. Either we’ll look back and realize we saved weeks of our lives, or we’ll find entirely new ways to cut down wasted time by orders of magnitude.
And whatever we do now to live longer and healthier might give us 1 or 2 more year, but in the future who know what crazy methods that will enlong our healthspan by 10-20 years!

Once people realize this, we might actually be on the brink of something huge, and **I want to be there.**
