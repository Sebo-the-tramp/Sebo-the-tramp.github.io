# Why this?

I have seen a video by Alex Hormozi about the season of NO. It said that we need to learn to say no. Say no to things that do not matter towards our goals, that they bring our focus away. It went on citing warren buffet:

{{< quote author="Warren Buffet">}}
You should do a list of your 25 goals, and then focus on the first 5. The other 20 are your distraction list. You should avoid them at all cost. You should just remove them from your life.
{{< /quote >}}

When I hear such strong statements, I get easily scared and just throw them away without thinking anymore. But since I have done the meditation, I try to be more equanimous and think a bit throught even the most extreme statements. I would like then try to create a list of my top 25 things. That at the end of my life I would like to have accomplished.


# The list (copilot version)

1. Have a family
2. Have a house
3. Have a job that I love
4. Have a job that I can do from anywhere
5. Have a job that I can do from home
6. Have a job that I can do from home and from anywhere
7. Have a job that I can do from home and from anywhere and that I love
8. Have a job that I can do from home and from anywhere and that I love and that I am good at
9. Have a job that I can do from home and from anywhere and that I love and that I am good at and that I can do with my family
10. Have a job that I can do from home and from anywhere and that I love and that I am good at and that I can do with my family and that I can do with my friends

Ok, I let copilot, write the last 10 lines, it was fun to let it write.

Now it's my turn!

# My list 

1. Get married
2. Have a family
3. Have children
4. Buy a house
5. Build a business
6. Study Artificial Intelligence
7. Build iRefill
8. Build a good phisique and keep it
9. Create a youtube channel and use it to share my knowledge


Then today I saw another video, where they had 101 goals. So I'll try to add them all and see where it goes.
