In the summer of 2021, I received an email. It was from the European association Climate-KIC, an European community that works to accelerate the transition to a zero emission
world. The email said: organize a climathon in your City. And that is what happened.

I asked around if there was some interest in such an event, and I got a good feedback from Veronica a friend of my town. Together we said, let's do it. 

After many days, many calls, many emails, and many associations contacted, we were able to organize and successfully run a climathon in our Valley.

It was an amazing experience. 40 people showed up and 7 projects were created to tackle our local challenges. Everybody was happy and so were we. I met so many new
people and young talents full of energy and desire to build, create and innovate. People that were my age and older, but we all shared the values of believing in 
creating a future for us.

And now after 1 year we are organizing it again! Will you be part of this journey and this adventure?

Check our website in the future to be able to save your spot at Climathon Predazzo 2023.

P.S. Small spoiler: It will be around the end of September, beginning of October.
