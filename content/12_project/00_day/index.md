# Day 0 – Beginning of infinity

## What I saw:
An opportunity.
After two intense years of my master’s — 99% done, some final words still to write — I saw a chance to move, travel, and breathe.
A short dive into the digital nomad life.
And I want to bring you with me — into this experiment of discovery, presence, and full-on adventure.

I won’t tell you what’s coming.
Every day is a surprise — for you, but also for me.
Only plane tickets are set. Everything else is open space.

Follow the visuals on social, the stories on YouTube…
But come back here only if you’re ready to face the final boss — truth.

## What I felt:
In the last two years, a lot happened.

I made a trade: I studied hard, and in doing so, I lost some precious things.

But I gained knowledge, perspective, and a few real friendships.

And, once again, I found what I always find in the end: I can make it alone. 
But now I carry a quiet awareness — that everything becomes more beautiful with the right people.

## What I learned:
I haven’t learned anything yet.
Not really.
The world is waiting.
I’m open now.

## A question for you:

{{< quote author="Me">}}
For me, this is another crazy thing I’m doing.
But what about you —
When was the last time you set out to do something that made you feel truly alive?
