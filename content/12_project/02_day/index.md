# Day 1 – Partire (Leaving)

## What I saw:
Another opportunity.
An opportunity to start a journey with friends—many, then a few—and eventually, just myself. An opportunity that comes with responsibilities, that comes with drawbacks and downsides. 
The good outweighed the bad. The return outweighed the cost. The opportunity was too big to say no.

I left. It is never easy. Especially when there is someone home waiting for you. I am so lucky that my family supports me to the fullest and encourages me to do the things I wish. It is the real "richness". That’s the real wealth. Not money. Not comfort. Just knowing someone’s always rooting for you. That’s what makes all this possible. 

And lately I have been leaving home "lighter". It's strange but now has become "routine".

## What I felt:
I usually feel lighter, full of energy and direction. Though I’m away for less time, the feeling hit harder this time. The belonging to my family and to my home, were dragging me back more than usual, and at the same time the unknown of this 12 days, was exciting me more than I thought.

## What I learned:
Well, I guess I had to come to know this a while ago when I really needed, that the people you can really count on are maybe a handful if you are lucky. They’re the ones who stay, through everything—literally everything. That’s what makes them worth calling family.
And those are the people that it will always be hard to leave when I start new adventures like this. They are the very reason I do this. They gave me the chance—and the foundation—for everything I’ve become.

## A question for you:

{{< quote author="Me, abstract from my thesis">}}
Family and friends are the soul’s anchors.
And you, when was the last time you were grateful for your people that made "leaving" so difficult?
