&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I had the opportunity to participate in the Pioneers4.0 Hackathon, organized by the Edge together with MoAT and partner LIPTON tea. It was a 72-hour event, where we had to develop an optimization solution to optimize the production and blending of tea.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was part of a team of 5 people, and we were able to develop a solution that was able to optimize the production of tea, considering the different types of tea and the different blends that could be made. We used a simple rule-based algorithm to optimize the production and blending of tea, and we were able to present a working prototype at the end of the event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a great experience, and I was able to learn a lot about the tea industry and the challenges that the industry faces. I also learned a lot about the different types of tea and the different blends that can be made. It was a great opportunity to work with a team of people from different backgrounds and to learn from each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also managed to win the competition with a mix of team-work, creativity as well as technical skills. It was a great experience and I am looking forward to participating in more hackathons in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks to the Edge and MoAT for organizing the event, and to LIPTON tea as well. I am looking forward to be part of the LIPTON team in the future, with the internship that I was awarded at the end of the event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following some pictures of the event:&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>This was a cyber-security challenge, in particular a capture the flag. I was lucky to get accepted in a team where a friend of mine was, since I my team-mate was sick
that day. I ended up in a team of super cool guys as well as very smart and experienced people. I learned a lot from them and I hope I was able to help them as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The challenges were 5 and after arriving 1 hour late, we were able to solve them all before every other team and with nearly half an hour of spare time. We were the first team to finish the challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I learned a lot and I was also able to give my small contribution, but without the team I would have never been able to do it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There we are:&lt;/p>

The system relies on Arduino, to automate and track the movement and the current position of the textile in the facility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An app will also enable the staff members to read and update any value related to the articles of clothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A dashboard will also be available to the management in order to have accurate monitoring of the situation as well as giving advice of the best and most efficient actions to be taken.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>HackZurich is the biggest hackathon in Europe. It was a priviledge for me to be selected among the participants. Again I knew nobody, but in the end I met some old friends from other hackathons, we teamed up, we won and most importantly we had so much fun. Check out the VLOG on youtube.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following are some of the photos:&lt;/p>
