&lt;p>&lt;p>Every day we read about new layoffs,
even in companies that once seemed untouchable.
And every time, I find myself asking the same question:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>👉 Are we teaching AI to do our jobs?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thousands of developers are training intelligent agents
to solve problems, write code, optimize processes… completely on their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The paradox?
It’s like programming your own dismissal,
line after line of code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A collective self-layoff,
perhaps unintended, but inevitable — unless we start asking ourselves:
what role do we want to play when machines can do everything we can?&lt;/p>
&lt;/p>&lt;span class="cite">&lt;span>― &lt;/span>&lt;span>Dario Cavada, &lt;/span>&lt;cite>https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387040204890456066/&lt;/cite>&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is the quote translated by ChatGPT fn the post itself, at the end you will find the original one. TL;DR, my dad is arguing that we (programmers) are &amp;ldquo;programming&amp;rdquo; our own lay of from AI. This because of today&amp;rsquo;s news about Meta&amp;rsquo;s layoff. Few friends commented that as very pessimistic and arguably it is. I wanted to reply something below his post but I felt few lines could not be in my favour so here it is, in between paper deadline, I am keen to write this piece which is quite dear to me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But where do I even start? I will go in order of the ideas that I wanted to reply&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="abstraction">Abstraction
&lt;/h2>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I am curios if programmers when compilers and high level languages were this pessimistic too&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>&lt;span class="cite">&lt;span>― &lt;/span>&lt;span>Sebastian Cavada, &lt;/span>&lt;cite>Reply n.1 I never posted&lt;/cite>&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is something that I reasoned about before. It is unintuitive, but someone before me shared it for sure. In particular in the 70s-80s when only programming language was ASSEMBLY, well most programmers were writing exactly in that language, then C came around, and C++ never mind python&amp;hellip; Such programmers might have thought: &amp;ldquo;If everything is offloaded to the compiler, we would do the same things in 1/10th of the time&amp;rdquo;, and we might be replaced. Well I think, and for my knowledge, high level languages are what inspired generations, and also made possible to build what we have available today. Could it be that AI is just another (MASSIVE) improvement in the abstraction of the code stack? Well, I think the first signs of that are already there, see Lovable, see how much more efficient are programmers, see how Tesla has built so much of his tech stack into software 2.0 which is just neural network based. Referring again GeoHot on similar topic to this post &lt;a class="link" href="https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2025/09/12/ai-coding.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a> but with some perks ;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus generally I&amp;rsquo;d like to see things in an optimistic way, because why not. And second because well it&amp;rsquo;s true that this technology is so new and so &amp;ldquo;alien&amp;rdquo; that we might not know what&amp;rsquo;s coming, what I think though is that we should leverage it, and there are so many possibilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="less-work-or-more">Less work, or more?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One assumption there, is that given that there are lays off, it means there is less work for everyone. I don&amp;rsquo;t agree on that either, thinking back at when agriculture was mainly done by hand. At that time a lot of people were involved, but then technology arrived and the number of people in agriculture became just a fraction of what it was before. I don&amp;rsquo;t see why that is not going to happen as well. Laying offs are (beside very sad, and with lot of negative ripercussions) a natural cycle of business, exactly as it is to open a business, as it is failing at a business. This very process is what led us here today, with this many tools that allows me to write and share with the world my thoughs. A very good turn over of the story is that probably the brilliance of these people will make them find a job instantly, as per many tweets already today of people trying to hire the &amp;ldquo;left out&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In general what I see and what I hope will be the future is more about being able to do the same amount of work with less people and more machines, more tokens from an intelligence that is trained to do that. But this will allow to people to do more of those things, and this is exactly where we need to be mindful and cautious.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="who-is-replacing-whom">Who is replacing whom?
&lt;/h2>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Maybe we should think about who owns this AI and how they are trying to lock us in?&lt;/p>&lt;span class="cite">&lt;span>― &lt;/span>&lt;span>Sebastian Cavada, &lt;/span>&lt;cite>Reply n.2 I never posted&lt;/cite>&lt;/span>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In the las period I have been thinking about this a lot. If manager and CEOs can lay off employees, why and how are they going to be replaced by? Well easy answer is AI. Yes but more technically? Well it&amp;rsquo;s about LLMs, with agentic capabilities, that can code, better (so they say) than a professional (not really correct maybe better than a freshman). Anyway, assuming this statement correct, than what? Well this agents are running somewhere, and not outside on the ground but in the cloud (small dad joke). So ultimately, employees in my mind are just being replaced by GPUs. Yes but GPUs + electricity (because GPUs without electricity are useless).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fun fact now the compute is not calculated anymore in FLOPS per second (Floating Point Operations Per Second) rather on a larger scale in Gigawatts, yes the unit of Energy! So now energy is directly converted in Computational Scale!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus employees (humans) are getting replaced by Tecnology, Electricity and you are correct some massime amount of numbers. But this reminds me about again and again, as most of the transitions that happened in humanity.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so-is-it-all-rainbows-and-unicorns">So is it all rainbows and unicorns?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Well I tend to be a tecno optimist (I think inspired by GeoHot) and mostly I think everything will go well and humanity as a whole will be fine. I like to think that those technologies, yes are driven by closed source, but open source is taking up faster and faster thanks to some key players. But we cannot rely on their benevolence forever. Things might change, OpenAI, going from non-profit to for-profit, Meta stopping the plans from LLama 5 (So it seems) and taking slightly different direction. Europe not knowing what the hell an LLM is, but wanting to enforce some weird laws anyway. China picking up speed at an unbelivable speed. Well probably that is exactly what we should talk about, not about laysoffs from meta, but rather the broader impact of AI.
Of course there will be so much to add to this paragraph, about security, AGI, etc, but on this I might refer the reader to the GeoHot blogpost titled &lt;a class="link" href="" >&lt;/a> -&amp;gt; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it now&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="in-the-end">In the end
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Trying to find the link in the previous paragraph I lost my flow.
Nevertheless what I wanted to add that is extremely important is that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be scared of this progress, we shall try to embrace it learn as much as we can and probably being suprised in the end.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The possibilities are limitless. If AI is so powerful and one day it will be, we will get access to free energy from nuclear fusion, we&amp;rsquo;ll get closer to quantum computers and guess, maybe we will be able to train LLMs on quantum computers. We might raise the minimum IQ points, of every child because instead of taking 5 years of elementary school they will go to a kindergarten where they will learn calculus by building with legos. They will engage in languages from 4-5 years old and grow up knowing 10 different languages. We could cure cancer, not only by editing genes and personalized cures, but and especially in the prevention of those, by optimal nutrition, sport, health, stress monitoring etc.
By the way I am not saying everything will be good, but the good will outweight the bad. But we need to be careful not to fall in the AI slope of infinite amount of funny videos generated by sora that will keep us attached to our phone and dopamine maxxing without any positive output for the society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And concluding I want to underline that I see infinite ways of creating a bright future, it’s up to us to choose whether we see the glass half empty, or overflowing with possibility.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;h2 id="what-i-saw">What I saw:
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>An opportunity.
After two intense years of my master’s — 99% done, some final words still to write — I saw a chance to move, travel, and breathe.
A short dive into the digital nomad life.
And I want to bring you with me — into this experiment of discovery, presence, and full-on adventure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won’t tell you what’s coming.
Every day is a surprise — for you, but also for me.
Only plane tickets are set. Everything else is open space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Follow the visuals on social, the stories on YouTube…
But come back here only if you’re ready to face the final boss — truth.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-i-felt">What I felt:
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In the last two years, a lot happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I made a trade: I studied hard, and in doing so, I lost some precious things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I gained knowledge, perspective, and a few real friendships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And, once again, I found what I always find in the end: I can make it alone.
But now I carry a quiet awareness — that everything becomes more beautiful with the right people.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-i-learned">What I learned:

Not really.
The world is waiting.
I’m open now.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I am referring to this concept only from today. I had this recurrent thoughts about how internet will look like in 2-3 years but it always felt the same. I think now we will more and more start to hear about web 4.0. Web 4.0 is the web of LLM, where not only user interact with users, but LLM can interact with other LLMs mostly but also other users (but as we will see later is a little counter productive).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-did-it-start">How did it start
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It all started from an iftar. Iftar is a tradition in Islamic culture, where people during Ramadan gather after the fasting period and shared the first meal after the whole day of not eating. Me and my team from our current startup &lt;a class="link" href="https://wellround.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Wellround&lt;/a> were discussing some ideas about data collection and LLMs and suddently the serendipity happened: we were able to connect the dots. In the future, maybe already here, maybe in few months LLMs will probably talk to other LLM and get shit done. Not just coding, not just answering our questions, but performing actions on our behalf. At &lt;a class="link" href="https://wellround.me" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Wellround&lt;/a> we are working on creating a digital twin of a person only from readily available data from smartwatchs, online services, daily reminders, calendars and what not. Turns out our vision was not big enough. We were told that we need to be able to tap into a bigger amount of data, there is where value is stored and not only, but mostly in the connection of this information, which is actually knowledge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Turns out that we can do more than that. What will happen when we let 2 LLMs discuss between each other, having a different background? What happens when that background is the context of 2 different persons?
Can we create some value between the interaction of two LLMs carrying informations of two different personas?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-most-importan-currency">The most importan currency
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I have talked in many previous blogs, how I find that the most precious currency and thing that every human being have is time. It is limited, period. We should make the most out of it, period. What if we could offload some tasks to LLMs? What are the tasks that we could offload to LLMs? What can we get out of it? More time exactly!
But how do we make LLMs effective to do this tasks as if they were us? Well, they indeed need to know us very well. Our interests, our hobbies, routines life, work etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="we-build-a-second-self">We build a second self!
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Our goal at wellround has always been to be able to aggregate data from multiple parties with a big focus on health data. What we have figured out while working on this task is why cann&amp;rsquo;t we aggregate more data and what is the use that we can then do with it? With the increasing amount of data that you aggregate from a person, you can create a digital twin, what we call &amp;lsquo;persona&amp;rsquo;. The more data points, the more accurate the description, the better the results when they are given to the LLM.
But what are the use cases? Well, just think of thinks you want to do to reach an outcome but don&amp;rsquo;t have time to?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Planning a trip with friends? Offload it to the framework that queries all the personas that are involved in the trip so that they can accomodate everyone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Want to find a new partner but don&amp;rsquo;t want to doom swipe? Let the LLM do the heavy lifting and &amp;ldquo;chat&amp;rdquo; with potential candidate&amp;rsquo;s LLMs and get back at you with just a few &amp;ldquo;potential dates&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Want to book a restaurant? Offload it to the LLM, and it will know your preferences, yor history, what you already had to eat that day and so on&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Need a psychologist? prompt our system to llok for one, and the LLM will search and will &amp;ldquo;talk&amp;rdquo; to different ones and get back at you with the one that matches your needs and has an expertise on the things you might be needing.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-we-do-that">How do we do that?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s the real question. The main problem is that all the data needs to be kept private and needs to be accessible by different applications in different ways, with different access rights. This is what we are currently figuring out. Another problem is that we need to understand where this data can be stored. Will it be a peer2peer network or will it be on the cloud with LLMs just querying this database on their own?&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I am here in the lab, some music, AC going waiting for some results to mess up more with my current understanding of the algorithm. I have completed 99% of my thesis. Last refinements and details are needed. I need to upload the dataset and show some cool visuals to show that I have been doing some cool stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall this journey has been though, full of insecurities, unplanned detours, long nights and lonely afternoons of writing code and hopeless debug.
I would do it all over again. This difficulties brought out only the best in me. It showed me how much I can handle and how much stress I can overcome. Fear of not being enough, impostor syndrome, living up to others and especially my expectations has been quite challenging. I don&amp;rsquo;t have a final answer, but if I learned something is that all these emotions need to be invited to the party. You can&amp;rsquo;t fake it, you can bury them, it will just waste energies in the wrong place. Like in Inside Out, they all contribute and we have to accept.&lt;br>
Also like in Vipassana Meditation, you should be equanimous, but my journey has been all other than equanimous. And now that I am stressing out for my thesis, I ask myself, is it really needed?
I feel that if I am not stressing out, means I am leaving stuff on the table, but this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the case. So here I want to report the findings of these 2 years that put me to the test and showed where my limits are and how can I eventually push them further. I hope someone can emphasize with me and feel a little less out of place.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="not-being-enough">Not Being Enough
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One of the biggest monster that I had to face was definitely not being enough. Most of my life I have been dangling from showing I was worth something to my parents by bringing home good marks, and do whatever I want. Most times I feel that I am only worth what I achieve, what I can program and the results I show. But this research path showed me how difficult that is in a game where nothing is predictable and your strength is seen in if you can push forward for one more time. The results are just downstream task. But then you ask yourself did I do enough.
Could I have done more? The only way I can answer to this is by spending all my waking ours working, only then I can say I have done all I could. The next step is to work smart, and that is what I am still learning. I feel though at some point I will reach a point in which I will recognize if I could have done more or if I was just lazy.
In the grand scheme of things, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to arrive at the end of my life and look back and say, I could have done better, why did I settle for mediocrity. I want to reach the end and have as little regrets as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="others-expectations">Others Expectations
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I guess I still care much what other thinks, and that has been fading a lot since the beginning, but one of my biggest fears is to let down, or come short of the expectations that people who believe in me. Some people gave me a lot, and I want to show them I am good, I recognize their time and effort and want to give back. But if than I can only give back less than what they expect, well I feel I didn&amp;rsquo;t live up to the expectations, or either they saw something in me that I was quite not able to bring it out. It seems a toxic trait, but I feel I have grown out of this, and it is still motivation to keep going.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="time-is-running-out">Time is running out
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is my all-time favourite. At some point in my 20s I realized time is running out. Yes we still might have 60+ years, but how many of this are going to be pristine. And at some point I need to be wise in the next 25 to be even wiser later. You know I feel now is the time to put the foundation of your life. You turn 18 and you think you have all your life and you can change anything, the World. Then you do some stuff you see people your age not caring at all and you are washed away with them. Some years down the line you wake up and see, what the hell I have been doing so far?
I am lucky as I realized that quite soon, have parents that care, and that see potential in me that sometimes I even fail to see. We should have more people like this in our life. That&amp;rsquo;s what I strive for.
So, you wake up and say cool, things do not just happen if I wish them to, but an intricate fabric of reality has to be forged in order for things to happen. Like meeting the right people, being in the right place, asking the right questions, and acting accordingly. Failing fast, failing often, saying yes to little, saying no to the rest. Focusing and doubling down on your bets.
That&amp;rsquo;s not easy, it takes courage, it takes determination and a lot of willingness to be a fool and to risk it all.
And after this, nothing is still certain, you have no guarantee of success or to be in the place you wish to. That is absolutely impossible to know. But you have to fucking believe and jump.
But time, time is not on our side, time has been the central part of everything, yet we know so little if something at all. We fight, we plan, we wait but it&amp;rsquo;s like the flow of the river, it just goes.
So unfortunately as all the others, I do not have any answer on this, but what I am trying to do is to find things and work that makes me feel I am swimming happily in this river of time without aggressively, going against the current but seeing where I will eventually land, by steering my direction accordingly to different opportunities and passions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="doing-meaningful-research">Doing meaningful research
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>That is still a point I don&amp;rsquo;t know how to address. Every time I think about a new idea, it&amp;rsquo;s out the next day from a big research lab. I am still figuring this out, but I think takes time and experience to really understand where the gaps are and how to address them.
One thing I learned though: meningful research is not done alone in front of the computer, but is done talking to peers, going to reading groups, random discussion with friends/collegues over coffee. That&amp;rsquo;s where it happens, then it is indeed written in the labs and in front of the computer.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="asking-the-right-questions">Asking the right questions
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is one of the most important and crucial things in my head for a long time. Whenever a professor asks are there questions, I am always hesitant to ask because I think someone might have a better question than me, which I can learn more than just asking my question which might be just because my lack of knowledge, but not really pushing for new point of views etc. That is where I am stuck at the moment. I feel that with more experience and dots, it will be easier to ask questions and connects things together.
I often attend presentations, and eagerly wait for my supervisor questions, because they are always critical but in such a way that everyone benefits and actually, given his experience are amazing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="execution">Execution
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Just exacute. Use all your available tools, go fast and accurate. During my thesis I was going too fast that my code bloated up, but with a minimal SW engineering I could have saved. Next time before starting a project and experiment things I might spend quite some time to create the infrastructure and the rest, so that down the line, things will get easier and not harder.
Hard first, easy later.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What about the future</title><link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/our-future/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 20:21:13 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/our-future/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/our-future/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post What about the future" />&lt;h1 id="the-future">The future
&lt;/h1>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>I believe two major forces will shape the future in ways we can barely imagine: AI and longevity. These two domains have the potential to redefine how we live, work, and think.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On one hand, advancements in computing power—whether through GPUs or whatever the fuck we are going to build next—will enable faster and more sophisticated manipulation of information. This will lead to the creation of new knowledge, insights, and innovations at an unprecedented pace. As we become more efficient at processing and generating ideas, we’ll also discover better ways to learn and understand. Speed will become a critical asset, not just for doing things faster but for learning and adapting more effectively. Every second saved—whether it’s shaving five seconds off a repetitive task like copy-pasting or streamlining complex workflows—will compound into significant gains over time. Time, after all, is the ultimate currency. Unlike money, which can be created, time is finite. We all have 24 hours in a day, but how we use those hours will determine our success.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where longevity comes into play. While everyone has the same 24 hours daily, not everyone has the same number of years. Some people live to 50, others to 80 or beyond. That difference translates to decades of additional time—time to create, learn, and contribute. And if we can extend not just lifespan but healthspan—ensuring those extra years are spent in good health, with a sharp mind and an active body—the impact could be transformative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the short term, saving five seconds here or gaining a year there might seem trivial. But over the long term, these small efficiencies and extensions compound. Five seconds saved on a task could turn into weeks or even months of reclaimed time over a lifetime. Similarly, an extra year of healthy life could snowball into decades of additional productivity and fulfillment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The winners of the future will be those who master these two domains. On one side, it will be the individuals or companies that create tools to maximize productivity—tools that help us work smarter, faster, and more effectively (think of the competition between Cursor and VSCode). On the other side, it will be those who unlock the secrets of longevity, enabling people to live longer, healthier, and more vibrant lives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once society fully grasps the potential of these two forces, we could be on the brink of something extraordinary. And I want to be there to see it—and be part of it.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;h2 id="intro">Intro
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So I spent the last 2 months trying out how to properly use and optimize COLMAP. Unfortunately most informations are buried in github issues, pull requests. You can get 70% from the official deocumentation, but most of the remaining I had to get it from trial and error and countless hors of searching trough GitHub trying to figure out if people had the same problem as I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found out so far that there are 2 main methods to improve results and can be directly impact the reconstruction without complicated tweaks in the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Better input. (garbage in, garbage out)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Settings finetuning for reconstruction&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll mainly talk about this two and maybe with some BONUS.&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="context">Context
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I am particularly interested in Large scale reconstructions from only images and visual clues. I think I chose the hardest path, but that is what I like. COLMAP has impressive results on small scale reconstruction, but when the number of images increase, and the kms that the reconstruction spans, there is where the real trubles are. For context I want to reconstruct around 1KM of my CAMPUS, and that has some challenges, plus the campus is very similar and many people lose themselves because of similarities, so I imagine why COLMAP has some shortcomings.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-input">Better Input
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>COLMAP relies on SIFT to extract features. During my countless tests, I found that to be quite reliable in standard settings, and using more sophisticated feature matchers, only increased complexity without a worthy reward. So I will stick to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What really mattered in the end, was to get the perfect time of the day and be able to capture with exactly the perfect lighting conditions. That improved the reconstruction drastically. Also I had to pick a time of the day where not many people are around because that will confuse the feature matching algorithm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I ended up waking up at 6.30 AM and walk around with 2 gopros and an helmet to get the perfect results. A little bit later and the sun would create the flares that will mess up with the features and ruine all the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fisrt advice:&lt;/strong> choose the best light conditions you possibly can get&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Second advice:&lt;/strong> avoid crowds and moving objects to avoid heavy postprocessing and iterate on the ideas faster&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Another thing that probably I casually discovered, is that if I walk a straight
line in front of me, the reconstruction is going to be suboptimal. Instead if I zig-zag, through the path, the result tend to be more accurate. At first the motivation for such a behaviour was unknown, but after carefully reading and understand the limitation of structure-from-motion, it was clearer that the problem becomes ill posed when following a co-linear motion.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Third advice:&lt;/strong> have a &amp;ldquo;zig-zag&amp;rdquo; movement while you capture the environment to avoid reconstruction &lt;strong>imprecisions&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>failures&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll try to add more as I learn but for now this is it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finetuning-settings">Finetuning settings
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I really had to fight hard for this one. I tried to use the more robust and &lt;strong>slower&lt;/strong> method of more discriminative feature matching:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>--SiftExtraction.estimate_affine_shape=true and --SiftExtraction.domain_size_pooling=true. In addition, you should enable guided feature matching using: --SiftMatching.guided_matching=true.&lt;/code> from &lt;a class="link" href="https://colmap.github.io/faq.html#:~:text=%2D%2DSiftExtraction.estimate_affine_shape%3Dtrue%20and%20%2D%2DSiftExtraction.domain_size_pooling%3Dtrue.%20In%20addition%2C%20you%20should%20enable%20guided%20feature%20matching%20using%3A%20%2D%2DSiftMatching.guided_matching%3Dtrue." target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It works but on extreme cases and at an enormous price, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even use the GPU. So I ended up sticking with the &amp;ldquo;Standard&amp;rdquo; procedure. I also only use sequential matching as videos benefits a lot from such processing strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An average reconstuction is done as following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Convert the video into a sequence of images&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run COLMAP&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enjoy (60% of the times)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>My goal is to improve the likelyhood of success.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="1-image-processing">1. Image processing
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>(Usually I deal with multiple cameras, that is why I heve the folder 00/ standing for the camera ID)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First I create a folder and then run the following command. You can choose the FPS, experimentally I saw that 3 is the best, sometimes 2 is also good if the movement pace is slow (e.g. human walk) otherwise you can try 4 if there are holes in the reconstruction or errors, most of the times that should fix. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t try 5 but most likely you need to go to the previous step and reiterate there.
(always talking for human walking velocity, if using bike or car, that is a whole differnt story)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>First I create a folder and then run the following command. You can choose the FPS, experimentally I saw that 3 is the best, sometimes 2 is also good if the movement pace is slow (e.g. human walk) otherwise you can try 4 if there are holes in the reconstruction or errors, most of the times that should fix. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t try 5 but most likely you need to go to the previous step and reiterate there.
(always talking for human walking velocity, if using bike or car, that is a whole differnt story)&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>During my the journey to understand Gaussian Splatting, I created Tinysplat as a hands-on project to explore its foundational concepts. By breaking down the complex process into more manageable parts, I aimed to simplify and clarify the underlying mechanisms. In this post, I’ll share the insights and discoveries I’ve made along the way, shedding light on the essentials of Gaussian Splatting through the lens of my experience with Tinysplat.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-gaussian-splatting">What is Gaussian Splatting?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Gaussian splatting is a novel explicit surface representation developed to represent the 3D structure of an object or an environment and then convert (rasterize) them into 2D images to be shown on our screens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2 most important pieces of this concept are: Gaussian and Splatting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="gaussians">Gaussians
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Gaussians is a shorthand for Gaussian distribution, which we are familiar from statistics in 1 dimension. Hold tight because in this process the dimensions of the Gaussian distribution will go up to 2 and 3. The most intuitive way to think of a Gaussian in 3 dimensions (with a lot of abuse in notation) is to think about it as a balloon. Of this balloon we can control different proprieties such as the rotation, the color, the size, by inflating it more or less etc.
Turns out that in the Gaussian Splatting process, we build the environment by merging together many of these balloons of different dimensions and colors at different positions in the space. Take a look at the following image:&lt;/p>

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can think of a car being made of many balloons at different positions and different sizes and colors, but then you can observe this shape from many points and always understand that this is a car.
And this brings us to the second key concept: splatting.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="splatting">Splatting
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Splatting is not a new concept and it refers to the technique of rendering each pixel on your monitor as the combination of many Gaussian-shaped &amp;ldquo;splats&amp;rdquo; (or balloons) by blending each contribution of each balloon given the camera position.
You might wonder what is special about this technique. Well in a single words it is DIFFERENTIABLE. It means that we can run back-propagation to whatever loss we have and therefore manipulating the properties of every balloons in our scene. To some degree we can think of differentiability as being a human inside the room that can listen to our commands shouting from a small window telling him where he should move every balloon to create an object. Without differentiability we would not have a way to communicate to the person inside.&lt;/p>

class="gallery-image"

data-flex-basis="240px"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Imagine there is no &amp;ldquo;open window&amp;rdquo; and no way for the two guys to communicate. Then the process will be NON differentiable. It is exactly the communication that was the key to enable many interesting applications of Gaussian splatting. Remember &amp;ldquo;Communication is key&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="but-why">But why?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Then you might ask why do we need to have a man inside a house inflating balloons and one guy outside observing and shouting?! Well that&amp;rsquo;s a fair question.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In proper terminology what this techniques enable is to learn from just a handful of images, on the order of the hundreds, a whole object or environment, so hopefully we can generate &amp;ldquo;novel views&amp;rdquo;. This fancy term refers basically that we can generate a rough 3D reconstruction from these images.
Again in technical terms we are over-fitting a scene or also inferring from the images we have at our disposal, what would the image look like from a completely different point of view that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In conclusion this technique is called explicit neural radiance Field. The explicit term references the fact that the parameters of the Gaussians are stored as is, and in the weights as in the NeRF representation for example. Radiance field instead is just a fancy word that was chosen to describe the way that rays are captured by the camera coming from all the scene.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="okay-balloons-and-communication-now-what">Okay, balloons and communication, now what?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a legit question. How do we even generate these Gaussians, and even how do we position them? We don&amp;rsquo;t have a human in the computer, let alone 2 people communicating!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The journey of creating a realistic scene is split into 2 parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Initialization of the priors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Fitting of the priors onto the images&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="priors-initialization">Priors initialization
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Gaussian splatting works better if we have already a rough idea of what the scene looks like. Imagine having some rough sketch of what you want, it is going to be easier to realize your masterpiece. In the same way, Gaussian Splatting works best when our initial sketch is a Point Cloud. A point cloud is exactly a way to define a rough sketch of the scene.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most common way to obtain is to run an algorithm called Structure from Motion. In other words given images of the scene from different positions it will triangulate the points and create a 3D representation which is close enough to reality. These methods are still improving and there is no best approach but it depends on many factors such as dimensions, motions etc. In the end this is still an open research question, therefore many more options (hopefully) are coming every month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here you can have a look of what that means. The red &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; (camera frustums), represent the rotation and position of the cameras in space, whilst the points (which should be colored), they represent the 4D space that was reconstructed. It is called &amp;ldquo;sparse&amp;rdquo; reconstruction because as you might have noticed, it is missing a lot of points, but the 3D high level idea can be interpreted by a human at least.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once this rough initialization has been created is time to go to next step.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fitting-of-the-gaussians-more-technical">Fitting of the Gaussians (more technical)
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This part is the most mindblowing and difficult, so take a deep breath and let&amp;rsquo;s dive into cold waters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we have some images, the position and rotation of the cameras, where the image was taken and the priors point cloud, the real training begins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It works very similar as in neural networks, where we have a set of parameters that needs to optimized using some gradient descent algorithm such as SGD. In this case all gaussians are initialized with the color and point in 3D space provided by the SfM algorithm. The scale and rotations are initialized as standard values such as 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During training we use these values to create and project the Gaussians onto the screen in a &lt;strong>differentiable manner&lt;/strong>. This will produce some strange images at first, by projecting all the gaussians to the screen that is orientated and positioned in the same way as the way the image was taken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This way we have a reference of what the image should be at that position, and what we actually get from the &amp;ldquo;splatting&amp;rdquo; process. Now you might have understood already, we can calculate a &lt;strong>loss&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>difference&lt;/strong> in similarity between the two images. There are 2 ways this difference is computed, and usually is a combination of different losses such as f1 loss, and SSIM loss, where $\lambda$ is a parameter used to balance the two accuracies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
(1 - \lambda) * \text{F1-loss(img1, img2)} + \lambda * \text{SSIM(img1, img2)}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this way iterating over the many images in the dataset, batch by batch, we can optimize the parameters of the whole number of Gaussians by backpropagating the error back to each gaussian based on the (sum) of the error(s) from every pixel in each image.
By optimizing these parameters, after some epochs, a clear image can be seen. A 2D example is displayed below. What you see is a video of the training where the Gaussians gets progressively refined and the final result is a sharp and crisp image.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Once this rough initialization has been created is time to go to next step.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fitting-of-the-gaussians-more-technical">Fitting of the Gaussians (more technical)
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This part is the most mindblowing and difficult, so take a deep breath and let&amp;rsquo;s dive into cold waters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we have some images, the position and rotation of the cameras, where the image was taken and the priors point cloud, the real training begins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It works very similar as in neural networks, where we have a set of parameters that needs to optimized using some gradient descent algorithm such as SGD. In this case all gaussians are initialized with the color and point in 3D space provided by the SfM algorithm. The scale and rotations are initialized as standard values such as 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During training we use these values to create and project the Gaussians onto the screen in a &lt;strong>differentiable manner&lt;/strong>. This will produce some strange images at first, by projecting all the gaussians to the screen that is orientated and positioned in the same way as the way the image was taken.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This way we have a reference of what the image should be at that position, and what we actually get from the &amp;ldquo;splatting&amp;rdquo; process. Now you might have understood already, we can calculate a &lt;strong>loss&lt;/strong> or &lt;strong>difference&lt;/strong> in similarity between the two images. There are 2 ways this difference is computed, and usually is a combination of different losses such as f1 loss, and SSIM loss, where $\lambda$ is a parameter used to balance the two accuracies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
(1 - \lambda) * \text{F1-loss(img1, img2)} + \lambda * \text{SSIM(img1, img2)}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this way iterating over the many images in the dataset, batch by batch, we can optimize the parameters of the whole number of Gaussians by backpropagating the error back to each gaussian based on the (sum) of the error(s) from every pixel in each image.
By optimizing these parameters, after some epochs, a clear image can be seen. A 2D example is displayed below. What you see is a video of the training where the Gaussians gets progressively refined and the final result is a sharp and crisp image.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I woke up this morning and as usual, the fatigue to go running was there. I did and ran my 6.5k in around 33 minutes, a very good time and a bit unexpected. Days like this are a sign of a good day. Then while having breakfast with my favorite news platform namely x.com, I started seeing so many posts about Gemini 1.5. Then suddenly a lot of videos and tweets about some text-video model. I was confused. I was excited. OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s name was there, it must be something big I thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I started watching the first video I was shocked. I thought this was light years away. And there I was with my cereal bowl and the best AI-generated videos I have ever seen. I was very excited.
At the same time I was also doubtful: &amp;ldquo;What am I studying for then&amp;rdquo;. Many things have been solved in AI already and this was a big step toward AGI, or as I would discover later to something else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, as much excited and doubtful as I was I went back to my desk and started studying Gradient Descent and learning rates. It was the right thing to do, but still, it was weird, that I felt I knew so little yet so much had been done.
After the session, I went to lunch with my dear friends Alvaro and Hassan. We discussed about random stuff and passports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started reading about this new model and the more video I was watching the more strange I was feeling. I saw some guy on the web doing already 3d reconstruction with such videos. I am working on the same topic. I had to try so I did.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in the meanwhile the highlight of the day and surely of the year, was that the GOAT Yann Le Cun was visiting the campus here today. When I found that out the previous day, I was thrilled. I always looked up to him as an example and took so much inspiration from his talks and works.
It was a unique moment of deep knowledge, critical thinking and first-principle reasoning. His insights were great and gave me hope for what I was thinking in the morning. My generation has the hope to still make an impact in the research field and hopefully as well for society and the world.
The questions were not many as the time was limited, and only a handful stood out to me as new and thought-provoking.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>My supervisor asked the question (that many are wondering) if academia can still compete with the industry in terms of research. The answer wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite clear, but the main point is that academia should challenge the industry with new ideas and most importantly propose new paradigms to solve the problems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The second clever question worth noting is about what are the pillars that are most likely unchanging in the future of AI. The answer comprised 4 main points: backpropagation, the gradient, the minimization of an objective and the GPU. The first three are needed for the learning itself, the latest is the bottleneck of the learning process.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Another worth mentioning concept was the way he mentioned that the Transformer can answer any question, but it will always answer questions using the same amount of computation. This is how it is trained, and what it is supposed to do. But we don&amp;rsquo;t behave like this. If a question is harder we spend more computational power/time to come up with the correct answer. I was enthusiastic about this concept and I feel it is worth exploring more.
These are some photos I was able to take with Yann Le Cun. The whole community was trying to get some photos and this is the best I could get.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>![A photo all together]A sneak peek of the talk](IMG_5686.jpg)![A closer selfie with the GOAT]I hope to see him in the future as he is a great scientist and engineer as he calls himself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All in all the day went pretty well, I was able to finish the 3D Gaussian reconstruction I started earlier, which led me to do a video and post it on YouTube. I got also some comments from the video of the campus tour of the university and I was happy to see that people are interested in what we are doing here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the result:&lt;/p>

&lt;/iframe>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>I might do a video about how I did it, and it is just simple software used one after the other. The peculiarity here is that the video was generated by an AI model, with emergent 3D capabilities. In other words, the 3D information was consistent throughout the video, and this is a big step toward the future of AI-generated videos.
This was also proved by the good even if not perfect results I got from the 3D reconstruction.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MBZUAI entrepreneurship school</title><link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/03_projects/mbzuai-entrepreneurship/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2024 10:21:13 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/03_projects/mbzuai-entrepreneurship/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/03_projects/mbzuai-entrepreneurship/1706553055846.jpeg" alt="Featured image of post MBZUAI entrepreneurship school" />&lt;p>🚀 A Milestone at the Entrepreneurship Pitch Day 🌟&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I am writing from the plane. I am in the first row in the middle. I feel I am very lucky. My week of lectures has ended this morning with a discussion on the migration problem in the EU. It was something I have never experienced because we had to take the side of the politicians that don’t accept or better want to protect the EU from immigration. Usually this is the opposite to what I think and it was good for me to push myself out of the bubble and try to see everything from a new prospective. I can’t lie that it was difficult to be in the shoes of people that uses hate and aversion towards the different and the unknown to get votes and get things done, because this is what it does boil down to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During this experience I really felt what it is to be on the other side and even more I realize how much I tend to be a “super-part” everyday life. Here is where the inception happens. Through meditation I learned to be equanimous and be balanced on most topics. Then reading the book “reality transurfing” in the past weeks I learned how wise and useful it is not to take any side in discussion or idealisms. And in the end this week I experienced the importance of taking a side and trying to be on the side of the right. And here I also see both the arguments to take a position and not to take a position. I am equanimous. According to the meditation we should always have in mind to reduce suffering and that’s what I have in mind for the future and I would always like to deploy all my resources towards this goal.
As a concluding anecdote, I wanted to share my experience with homeless people I met in Bruxelles, because yes where the most money are the most poverty is as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This homeless people where there on the streets and I wanted to do anything to help. Probably I didn’t. I could have shared a loaf of bread that in the end I had to throw away. I could have brought them some items I have bought from too good to go, but I felt it was wrong and I felt embarrassed, but most of all I didn’t know if that was the right way to act. In this regard I think there is no, or very little, actions that can be done at that very moment to solve something, but I am a big fun of compounded interest and doing small, or big, things over a long period of time in order to really solve a problem.
This proved to be successful different times. Especially I realized this with my education: there was no single thing that I could have done different, because in the end they brought me at this point. Now I really want to focus only on a handful things, do them at a very high level and be able then to give value to many through my work and time. With this I want to say that we are in this together, we are all excellent at speaking or writing, but will we have the courage to act and really put our words into actions?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I hope so and I will bring this experience with me and use it as a tool for my next decisions to be aligned with the goal of giving the most and making this place a little better because of my presence. If I could help a single person than my goal will be fulfilled.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are in a cloud now, there is some turbulence and I will have to close now.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="part-2---the-train">Part 2 - the train
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I start to write the second and conclusive part here in the train. I was able to get a good train going to Pandora and I am still active and I feel I would like to write or relax.
I still don’t believe what happened on the plane. It is so strange, yet so beautiful. Some times I think is karma other I just understand that it is only a coincidence. Maybe it was just how the algorithms of Ryanair works in assigning random places. Actually it probably don’t assign random all places but it will prefer the ones that has no additional value first. Then maybe I was a bit late for the check in and they first because all the others were already taken (?). This is a big supposition but I am grateful that happen, and at the same time I now realized that I should be equanimous and don’t crave this feelings but rather really live to the fullest every day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On this proposition I realized how better it is to really always try to live to the fullest. Life is short and it does not have any prefixed length. So living everyday in the present is the real life hack. And also memento more has become increasingly more important as if a person lives a life with a purpose and a direction whenever it will end it will be a good life. If someone might not have a purpose or direction that might be a bit more difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let me know what you think in this regard in the comments and I will leave you with a couple of photos of my and our class in Bruxelles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ciao!&lt;/p>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t think chatGPT needs much of an introduction. It entered in our lives in late November and it is not going to go away for a long while now. It allows user to write some prompts and get a Natural Language model to answer in any language an to pretty much any question that he get posed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In one way or another, most of us has come into contact with this &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; Fanta scientific technology coming from the future. This is the trajectory we are going to follow for the next years. If there are 20 &amp;ldquo;Megatrends&amp;rdquo; well AI is going to lead them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But enough with speculations, I wanted to share my thoughts on the ethic of using such tools in every day life and where might the boundaries be, from using it to sharpen our knowledge or to fake being smart and pretend to be someone else.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Therefore I asked to the direct interested one. ChatGPT.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-input">The input
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Is it ethical for a student to use chatGPT, in order to write faster motivational letters, and draft of emails in order to save time to concentrate more on other creative stuff, research and in general other more interesting stuff, given that is not counterproductive? Another example would be to write a motivational letter to enter a course in which he has a lot of interest but too many things to do for preparing a well written and professional text&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-answer">The answer
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether using a tool like ChatGPT to write motivational letters or emails is ethical. However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of using such a tool. If the student&amp;rsquo;s use of ChatGPT results in a letter or email that is not their own work and does not accurately reflect their own thoughts and writing abilities, it could be considered plagiarism and may lead to disciplinary action. Additionally, if the student relies too heavily on ChatGPT and does not put in the effort to improve their own writing skills, they may not be adequately prepared for future academic or professional writing tasks. Ultimately, it&amp;rsquo;s best to use these tools as a tool to help you and not a replacement of your own efforts and skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="well">Well
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The answer is sharp and concise.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If the student&amp;rsquo;s use of ChatGPT results in a letter or email that is not their own work and does not accurately reflect their own thoughts and writing abilities, it could be considered plagiarism and may lead to disciplinary action.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This short phrase, collects all my thoughts and showcase them in the most brilliant form. The reflection of our own abilities can really be seen in a text, but mostly our actions and things we did and that we take as ours.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-my-grandmother-thinks">What my grandmother thinks
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I have talked about this tool with my grandmother and as always when I talk about technology she feels far away from this witchcrafts. She said something interesting thought that can be taken as a starting point of some thoughts flow.
She said and I quote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Everything great is done by people, just like you and if you want to do something great it has to come from yourself.&lt;/p>&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>She is literally afraid of what technology can do even if she acknowledges what good has been brought by innovations. Having said that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to do with such things, she is too old to learn.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="finally-me">Finally me
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In the end I don&amp;rsquo;t have any answer in this world, yet(?), but something I can tell for sure. If the goal is to go from A to B, you might decide to get by bike, by foot or even by car. I think is ultimately up to us to choose the method in which we reach any goal. Surely it has to be consistent to our thoughts, and just because we have a car and therefore we can visit all the places in a year that will take a lifetime to do by foot, means we are better off. We just had a different journey, maybe it was even worst then the second person&amp;rsquo;s one. I hope you can see the analogy here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The goal and the end of a person has to stay the same, with time this tool will allow to get there, with less risks, maybe even faster and with some different path. Ultimately is the goal we reach that fulfil ourselves and the journey we took there, definitely not the tools used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we can learn during the process, always be integrity with ourselves and never faking our abilities and accomplishments, it will become irrelevant which tools are we using and why.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="i-am-no-oracle">I am no Oracle
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is how I came to think now, but I am very curios about other&amp;rsquo;s prospective and ideas. Let&amp;rsquo;s create a healthy discussion in the comments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The frog in the pot</title><link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/the-frog-in-the-pot/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 14:36:13 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/the-frog-in-the-pot/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/the-frog-in-the-pot/cover.JPG" alt="Featured image of post The frog in the pot" />&lt;h1 id="the-boiling-frog-an-analogy-for-climate-change">The Boiling Frog: An Analogy for Climate Change
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>The story of the boiling frog is a well-known analogy for the gradual and insidious nature of change. The tale goes that if a frog is placed in a pot of boiling water, it will immediately jump out to safety. However, if a frog is placed in a pot of cool water that is slowly heated, it will not notice the change and eventually be boiled to death.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="now">Now
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This analogy can be applied to the current situation of climate change. The Earth&amp;rsquo;s temperature is slowly and steadily rising, and many people are not taking notice or taking action. Just like the frog in the pot, we are becoming accustomed to the gradual changes and not realizing the danger we are in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how">How
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Climate change is caused by human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These actions release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising the Earth&amp;rsquo;s temperature. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, from rising sea levels and more intense storms, to droughts and wildfires.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="denial">Denial
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence of the reality and seriousness of climate change, there is still a significant portion of the population that denies or downplays the issue. This lack of action and denial can have dire consequences for future generations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="so">So
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The question remains, will we, as a society, take the necessary steps to reduce our carbon footprint and slow down climate change before it&amp;rsquo;s too late? Or will we, like the frog in the pot, be boiled to death by our own inaction?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="then">Then?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: We must take immediate and decisive action to address climate change before it&amp;rsquo;s too late. The future of humanity depends on it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My First Post</title><link>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2022 20:21:13 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/hello-world/cover.jpg" alt="Featured image of post My First Post" />&lt;h1 id="the-motto-of-my-life">The motto of my life
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>This is a great question that I came across today. I thought it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be too hard to come up with one, since I have so many thoughts and I am creative. That, sadly, didn&amp;rsquo;t happen. I turned then to a quote by Elon Musk, just to close and send the form I was filling. It was &amp;ldquo;Solve climate change or die trying&amp;rdquo;. I soon realized that it didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like mine but I sent the quote anyway because I had spent too much time on this. I need to think of a motto for my future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tragedy">Tragedy
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For me that I always had, and still have mentors, people that really inspire me, is difficult to go off the known path and continue on the path less traveled. I know it is a trivial thing to do if I want to accomplish anything. But here I am struggling on a simple and &amp;ldquo;to be&amp;rdquo; catchy phrase.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-now">What now
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Now I think I am still dealing with som past experiences, and just recently got over them and accepted. I am finding a new path to follow for my life. A small light is appearing at the end of the tunnel. This has been a dark age of mine, and still is, but the fact that I reached the bottom, or so it seems, gives me hope.
I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen into the hopelessness hole and I was dizzily falling. One day I grasped on a though, actually a book. The essentialism. It gave me hope and a strong direction to follow.
Here I am putting my future actions into words. The most difficult and dangling part.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="getting-back-to-the-point">Getting back to the point
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In this moment I am taking the wheel of my life again, and I can think clearly only for a couple weeks now. This gives me hope in finding a new motto for my life. An original and unique one. One that resembles my optimism for the future, the hope in humanity, but that still keeps me humble in my infinitesimal littleness, but with the willingness to change the world for the better&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-next-step">The next step
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Is only one step forward. In the unknown. But is one and it must be steady.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
