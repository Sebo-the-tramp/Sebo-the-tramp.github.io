[{"content":" Every day we read about new layoffs, even in companies that once seemed untouchable. And every time, I find myself asking the same question:\n👉 Are we teaching AI to do our jobs?\nThousands of developers are training intelligent agents to solve problems, write code, optimize processes… completely on their own.\nThe paradox? It’s like programming your own dismissal, line after line of code.\nA collective self-layoff, perhaps unintended, but inevitable — unless we start asking ourselves: what role do we want to play when machines can do everything we can?\n― Dario Cavada, https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387040204890456066/ This is the quote translated by ChatGPT fn the post itself, at the end you will find the original one. TL;DR, my dad is arguing that we (programmers) are \u0026ldquo;programming\u0026rdquo; our own lay of from AI. This because of today\u0026rsquo;s news about Meta\u0026rsquo;s layoff. Few friends commented that as very pessimistic and arguably it is. I wanted to reply something below his post but I felt few lines could not be in my favour so here it is, in between paper deadline, I am keen to write this piece which is quite dear to me.\nBut where do I even start? I will go in order of the ideas that I wanted to reply\nAbstraction I am curios if programmers when compilers and high level languages were this pessimistic too\u0026hellip;\n― Sebastian Cavada, Reply n.1 I never posted This is something that I reasoned about before. It is unintuitive, but someone before me shared it for sure. In particular in the 70s-80s when only programming language was ASSEMBLY, well most programmers were writing exactly in that language, then C came around, and C++ never mind python\u0026hellip; Such programmers might have thought: \u0026ldquo;If everything is offloaded to the compiler, we would do the same things in 1/10th of the time\u0026rdquo;, and we might be replaced. Well I think, and for my knowledge, high level languages are what inspired generations, and also made possible to build what we have available today. Could it be that AI is just another (MASSIVE) improvement in the abstraction of the code stack? Well, I think the first signs of that are already there, see Lovable, see how much more efficient are programmers, see how Tesla has built so much of his tech stack into software 2.0 which is just neural network based. Referring again GeoHot on similar topic to this post here but with some perks ;).\nThus generally I\u0026rsquo;d like to see things in an optimistic way, because why not. And second because well it\u0026rsquo;s true that this technology is so new and so \u0026ldquo;alien\u0026rdquo; that we might not know what\u0026rsquo;s coming, what I think though is that we should leverage it, and there are so many possibilities.\nLess work, or more? One assumption there, is that given that there are lays off, it means there is less work for everyone. I don\u0026rsquo;t agree on that either, thinking back at when agriculture was mainly done by hand. At that time a lot of people were involved, but then technology arrived and the number of people in agriculture became just a fraction of what it was before. I don\u0026rsquo;t see why that is not going to happen as well. Laying offs are (beside very sad, and with lot of negative ripercussions) a natural cycle of business, exactly as it is to open a business, as it is failing at a business. This very process is what led us here today, with this many tools that allows me to write and share with the world my thoughs. A very good turn over of the story is that probably the brilliance of these people will make them find a job instantly, as per many tweets already today of people trying to hire the \u0026ldquo;left out\u0026rdquo;.\nIn general what I see and what I hope will be the future is more about being able to do the same amount of work with less people and more machines, more tokens from an intelligence that is trained to do that. But this will allow to people to do more of those things, and this is exactly where we need to be mindful and cautious.\nWho is replacing whom? Maybe we should think about who owns this AI and how they are trying to lock us in?\n― Sebastian Cavada, Reply n.2 I never posted In the las period I have been thinking about this a lot. If manager and CEOs can lay off employees, why and how are they going to be replaced by? Well easy answer is AI. Yes but more technically? Well it\u0026rsquo;s about LLMs, with agentic capabilities, that can code, better (so they say) than a professional (not really correct maybe better than a freshman). Anyway, assuming this statement correct, than what? Well this agents are running somewhere, and not outside on the ground but in the cloud (small dad joke). So ultimately, employees in my mind are just being replaced by GPUs. Yes but GPUs + electricity (because GPUs without electricity are useless).\nFun fact now the compute is not calculated anymore in FLOPS per second (Floating Point Operations Per Second) rather on a larger scale in Gigawatts, yes the unit of Energy! So now energy is directly converted in Computational Scale!\nThus employees (humans) are getting replaced by Tecnology, Electricity and you are correct some massime amount of numbers. But this reminds me about again and again, as most of the transitions that happened in humanity.\nSo is it all rainbows and unicorns? Well I tend to be a tecno optimist (I think inspired by GeoHot) and mostly I think everything will go well and humanity as a whole will be fine. I like to think that those technologies, yes are driven by closed source, but open source is taking up faster and faster thanks to some key players. But we cannot rely on their benevolence forever. Things might change, OpenAI, going from non-profit to for-profit, Meta stopping the plans from LLama 5 (So it seems) and taking slightly different direction. Europe not knowing what the hell an LLM is, but wanting to enforce some weird laws anyway. China picking up speed at an unbelivable speed. Well probably that is exactly what we should talk about, not about laysoffs from meta, but rather the broader impact of AI. Of course there will be so much to add to this paragraph, about security, AGI, etc, but on this I might refer the reader to the GeoHot blogpost titled -\u0026gt; I couldn\u0026rsquo;t find it now\nIn the end Trying to find the link in the previous paragraph I lost my flow. Nevertheless what I wanted to add that is extremely important is that we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be scared of this progress, we shall try to embrace it learn as much as we can and probably being suprised in the end.\nThe possibilities are limitless. If AI is so powerful and one day it will be, we will get access to free energy from nuclear fusion, we\u0026rsquo;ll get closer to quantum computers and guess, maybe we will be able to train LLMs on quantum computers. We might raise the minimum IQ points, of every child because instead of taking 5 years of elementary school they will go to a kindergarten where they will learn calculus by building with legos. They will engage in languages from 4-5 years old and grow up knowing 10 different languages. We could cure cancer, not only by editing genes and personalized cures, but and especially in the prevention of those, by optimal nutrition, sport, health, stress monitoring etc. By the way I am not saying everything will be good, but the good will outweight the bad. But we need to be careful not to fall in the AI slope of infinite amount of funny videos generated by sora that will keep us attached to our phone and dopamine maxxing without any positive output for the society.\nAnd concluding I want to underline that I see infinite ways of creating a bright future, it’s up to us to choose whether we see the glass half empty, or overflowing with possibility.\nAn employee getting fired might finally find the courage to start the new venture that will revolutionize the world.\n― Sebastian Cavada, Reply n.3 I never posted The original post: Ogni giorno leggiamo di nuovi licenziamenti, anche in aziende che sembravano intoccabili. E ogni volta mi viene la stessa domanda:\n👉 Stiamo insegnando alle AI a fare il nostro lavoro?\nMigliaia di sviluppatori addestrano agenti intelligenti a risolvere problemi, scrivere codice, ottimizzare processi… in completa autonomia.\nIl paradosso?

I had this recurrent thoughts about how internet will look like in 2-3 years but it always felt the same. I think now we will more and more start to hear about web 4.0. Web 4.0 is the web of LLM, where not only user interact with users, but LLM can interact with other LLMs mostly but also other users (but as we will see later is a little counter productive).\nHow did it start It all started from an iftar. Iftar is a tradition in Islamic culture, where people during Ramadan gather after the fasting period and shared the first meal after the whole day of not eating. Me and my team from our current startup Wellround were discussing some ideas about data collection and LLMs and suddently the serendipity happened: we were able to connect the dots. In the future, maybe already here, maybe in few months LLMs will probably talk to other LLM and get shit done. Not just coding, not just answering our questions, but performing actions on our behalf. At Wellround we are working on creating a digital twin of a person only from readily available data from smartwatchs, online services, daily reminders, calendars and what not. Turns out our vision was not big enough. We were told that we need to be able to tap into a bigger amount of data, there is where value is stored and not only, but mostly in the connection of this information, which is actually knowledge.\nTurns out that we can do more than that. What will happen when we let 2 LLMs discuss between each other, having a different background? What happens when that background is the context of 2 different persons? Can we create some value between the interaction of two LLMs carrying informations of two different personas?\nThe most importan currency I have talked in many previous blogs, how I find that the most precious currency and thing that every human being have is time. It is limited, period. We should make the most out of it, period. What if we could offload some tasks to LLMs? What are the tasks that we could offload to LLMs? What can we get out of it? More time exactly! But how do we make LLMs effective to do this tasks as if they were us? Well, they indeed need to know us very well. Our interests, our hobbies, routines life, work etc\u0026hellip;\nWe build a second self! Our goal at wellround has always been to be able to aggregate data from multiple parties with a big focus on health data. What we have figured out while working on this task is why cann\u0026rsquo;t we aggregate more data and what is the use that we can then do with it? With the increasing amount of data that you aggregate from a person, you can create a digital twin, what we call \u0026lsquo;persona\u0026rsquo;. The more data points, the more accurate the description, the better the results when they are given to the LLM. But what are the use cases? Well, just think of thinks you want to do to reach an outcome but don\u0026rsquo;t have time to?\nPlanning a trip with friends? Offload it to the framework that queries all the personas that are involved in the trip so that they can accomodate everyone. Want to find a new partner but don\u0026rsquo;t want to doom swipe? Let the LLM do the heavy lifting and \u0026ldquo;chat\u0026rdquo; with potential candidate\u0026rsquo;s LLMs and get back at you with just a few \u0026ldquo;potential dates\u0026rdquo; Want to book a restaurant? Offload it to the LLM, and it will know your preferences, yor history, what you already had to eat that day and so on\u0026hellip; Need a psychologist? prompt our system to llok for one, and the LLM will search and will \u0026ldquo;talk\u0026rdquo; to different ones and get back at you with the one that matches your needs and has an expertise on the things you might be needing. How do we do that? That\u0026rsquo;s the real question. The main problem is that all the data needs to be kept private and needs to be accessible by different applications in different ways, with different access rights. This is what we are currently figuring out. Another problem is that we need to understand where this data can be stored. Will it be a peer2peer network or will it be on the cloud with LLMs just querying this database on their own?\nStay tuned at Wellround.me to find out!\nIf you are motivate and brilliant SW, ML engineer and/or cloud architect reach out to me at sebastian.cavada.dev@gmail.com to create a real and valuable future together!\n","date":"2025-03-25T10:21:13+02:00","image":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/big_bet/cover_hu5996750948104873876.JPG","permalink":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/big_bet/","title":"The big bet"},{"content":"Thoughts on my Mast3r I am here in the lab, some music, AC going waiting for some results to mess up more with my current understanding of the algorithm. I have completed 99% of my thesis. Last refinements and details are needed. I need to upload the dataset and show some cool visuals to show that I have been doing some cool stuff.\nOverall this journey has been though, full of insecurities, unplanned detours, long nights and lonely afternoons of writing code and hopeless debug. I would do it all over again. This difficulties brought out only the best in me. It showed me how much I can handle and how much stress I can overcome. Fear of not being enough, impostor syndrome, living up to others and especially my expectations has been quite challenging. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a final answer, but if I learned something is that all these emotions need to be invited to the party. You can\u0026rsquo;t fake it, you can bury them, it will just waste energies in the wrong place. Like in Inside Out, they all contribute and we have to accept.\nAlso like in Vipassana Meditation, you should be equanimous, but my journey has been all other than equanimous. And now that I am stressing out for my thesis, I ask myself, is it really needed? I feel that if I am not stressing out, means I am leaving stuff on the table, but this shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the case. So here I want to report the findings of these 2 years that put me to the test and showed where my limits are and how can I eventually push them further. I hope someone can emphasize with me and feel a little less out of place.\nNot Being Enough One of the biggest monster that I had to face was definitely not being enough. Most of my life I have been dangling from showing I was worth something to my parents by bringing home good marks, and do whatever I want. Most times I feel that I am only worth what I achieve, what I can program and the results I show. But this research path showed me how difficult that is in a game where nothing is predictable and your strength is seen in if you can push forward for one more time. The results are just downstream task. But then you ask yourself did I do enough. Could I have done more? The only way I can answer to this is by spending all my waking ours working, only then I can say I have done all I could. The next step is to work smart, and that is what I am still learning. I feel though at some point I will reach a point in which I will recognize if I could have done more or if I was just lazy. In the grand scheme of things, I don\u0026rsquo;t want to arrive at the end of my life and look back and say, I could have done better, why did I settle for mediocrity. I want to reach the end and have as little regrets as possible.\nOthers Expectations I guess I still care much what other thinks, and that has been fading a lot since the beginning, but one of my biggest fears is to let down, or come short of the expectations that people who believe in me. Some people gave me a lot, and I want to show them I am good, I recognize their time and effort and want to give back. But if than I can only give back less than what they expect, well I feel I didn\u0026rsquo;t live up to the expectations, or either they saw something in me that I was quite not able to bring it out. It seems a toxic trait, but I feel I have grown out of this, and it is still motivation to keep going.\nTime is running out This is my all-time favourite. At some point in my 20s I realized time is running out. Yes we still might have 60+ years, but how many of this are going to be pristine. And at some point I need to be wise in the next 25 to be even wiser later. You know I feel now is the time to put the foundation of your life. You turn 18 and you think you have all your life and you can change anything, the World. Then you do some stuff you see people your age not caring at all and you are washed away with them. Some years down the line you wake up and see, what the hell I have been doing so far? I am lucky as I realized that quite soon, have parents that care, and that see potential in me that sometimes I even fail to see. We should have more people like this in our life. That\u0026rsquo;s what I strive for. So, you wake up and say cool, things do not just happen if I wish them to, but an intricate fabric of reality has to be forged in order for things to happen. Like meeting the right people, being in the right place, asking the right questions, and acting accordingly. Failing fast, failing often, saying yes to little, saying no to the rest. Focusing and doubling down on your bets. That\u0026rsquo;s not easy, it takes courage, it takes determination and a lot of willingness to be a fool and to risk it all. And after this, nothing is still certain, you have no guarantee of success or to be in the place you wish to. That is absolutely impossible to know. But you have to fucking believe and jump. But time, time is not on our side, time has been the central part of everything, yet we know so little if something at all. We fight, we plan, we wait but it\u0026rsquo;s like the flow of the river, it just goes. So unfortunately as all the others, I do not have any answer on this, but what I am trying to do is to find things and work that makes me feel I am swimming happily in this river of time without aggressively, going against the current but seeing where I will eventually land, by steering my direction accordingly to different opportunities and passions.\nDoing meaningful research That is still a point I don\u0026rsquo;t know how to address. Every time I think about a new idea, it\u0026rsquo;s out the next day from a big research lab. I am still figuring this out, but I think takes time and experience to really understand where the gaps are and how to address them. One thing I learned though: meningful research is not done alone in front of the computer, but is done talking to peers, going to reading groups, random discussion with friends/collegues over coffee. That\u0026rsquo;s where it happens, then it is indeed written in the labs and in front of the computer.\nAsking the right questions This is one of the most important and crucial things in my head for a long time. Whenever a professor asks are there questions, I am always hesitant to ask because I think someone might have a better question than me, which I can learn more than just asking my question which might be just because my lack of knowledge, but not really pushing for new point of views etc. That is where I am stuck at the moment. I feel that with more experience and dots, it will be easier to ask questions and connects things together. I often attend presentations, and eagerly wait for my supervisor questions, because they are always critical but in such a way that everyone benefits and actually, given his experience are amazing.\nExecution Just exacute. Use all your available tools, go fast and accurate. During my thesis I was going too fast that my code bloated up, but with a minimal SW engineering I could have saved. Next time before starting a project and experiment things I might spend quite some time to create the infrastructure and the rest, so that down the line, things will get easier and not harder. Hard first, easy later.\n","date":"2025-03-19T10:21:13+02:00","image":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/mast3r_lessons/cover_hu4728746294925556402.jpeg","permalink":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/mast3r_lessons/","title":"Thougts from my Mast3r and the past 25 years"},{"content":"The future I believe two major forces will shape the future in ways we can barely imagine: AI and longevity. These two domains have the potential to redefine how we live, work, and think.\nOn one hand, advancements in computing power—whether through GPUs or whatever the fuck we are going to build next—will enable faster and more sophisticated manipulation of information. This will lead to the creation of new knowledge, insights, and innovations at an unprecedented pace. As we become more efficient at processing and generating ideas, we’ll also discover better ways to learn and understand. Speed will become a critical asset, not just for doing things faster but for learning and adapting more effectively. Every second saved—whether it’s shaving five seconds off a repetitive task like copy-pasting or streamlining complex workflows—will compound into significant gains over time. Time, after all, is the ultimate currency. Unlike money, which can be created, time is finite. We all have 24 hours in a day, but how we use those hours will determine our success.\nThis is where longevity comes into play. While everyone has the same 24 hours daily, not everyone has the same number of years. Some people live to 50, others to 80 or beyond. That difference translates to decades of additional time—time to create, learn, and contribute. And if we can extend not just lifespan but healthspan—ensuring those extra years are spent in good health, with a sharp mind and an active body—the impact could be transformative.\nIn the short term, saving five seconds here or gaining a year there might seem trivial. But over the long term, these small efficiencies and extensions compound. Five seconds saved on a task could turn into weeks or even months of reclaimed time over a lifetime. Similarly, an extra year of healthy life could snowball into decades of additional productivity and fulfillment.\nThe winners of the future will be those who master these two domains. On one side, it will be the individuals or companies that create tools to maximize productivity—tools that help us work smarter, faster, and more effectively (think of the competition between Cursor and VSCode). On the other side, it will be those who unlock the secrets of longevity, enabling people to live longer, healthier, and more vibrant lives.\nOnce society fully grasps the potential of these two forces, we could be on the brink of something extraordinary. And I want to be there to see it—and be part of it.\nhttps://chatgpt.com/share/67b0d448-a4a8-8008-96ad-d8c78ac2a36a 😉\n","date":"2025-02-14T20:21:13+02:00","image":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/our-future/cover_hu2213876781356467048.jpg","permalink":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/our-future/","title":"What about the future"},{"content":"COLMAP - a guide for optimal results Intro So I spent the last 2 months trying out how to properly use and optimize COLMAP. Unfortunately most informations are buried in github issues, pull requests. You can get 70% from the official deocumentation, but most of the remaining I had to get it from trial and error and countless hors of searching trough GitHub trying to figure out if people had the same problem as I did.\nI found out so far that there are 2 main methods to improve results and can be directly impact the reconstruction without complicated tweaks in the code.\nBetter input. (garbage in, garbage out) Settings finetuning for reconstruction I\u0026rsquo;ll mainly talk about this two and maybe with some BONUS.\nContext I am particularly interested in Large scale reconstructions from only images and visual clues. I think I chose the hardest path, but that is what I like. COLMAP has impressive results on small scale reconstruction, but when the number of images increase, and the kms that the reconstruction spans, there is where the real trubles are. For context I want to reconstruct around 1KM of my CAMPUS, and that has some challenges, plus the campus is very similar and many people lose themselves because of similarities, so I imagine why COLMAP has some shortcomings.\nBetter Input COLMAP relies on SIFT to extract features. During my countless tests, I found that to be quite reliable in standard settings, and using more sophisticated feature matchers, only increased complexity without a worthy reward. So I will stick to it.\nWhat really mattered in the end, was to get the perfect time of the day and be able to capture with exactly the perfect lighting conditions. That improved the reconstruction drastically. Also I had to pick a time of the day where not many people are around because that will confuse the feature matching algorithm.\nI ended up waking up at 6.30 AM and walk around with 2 gopros and an helmet to get the perfect results. A little bit later and the sun would create the flares that will mess up with the features and ruine all the process.\nFisrt advice: choose the best light conditions you possibly can get\nSecond advice: avoid crowds and moving objects to avoid heavy postprocessing and iterate on the ideas faster\nAnother thing that probably I casually discovered, is that if I walk a straight line in front of me, the reconstruction is going to be suboptimal. Instead if I zig-zag, through the path, the result tend to be more accurate. At first the motivation for such a behaviour was unknown, but after carefully reading and understand the limitation of structure-from-motion, it was clearer that the problem becomes ill posed when following a co-linear motion.\nThird advice: have a \u0026ldquo;zig-zag\u0026rdquo; movement while you capture the environment to avoid reconstruction imprecisions or failures\nI\u0026rsquo;ll try to add more as I learn but for now this is it.\nFinetuning settings I really had to fight hard for this one. I tried to use the more robust and slower method of more discriminative feature matching:\n--SiftExtraction.estimate_affine_shape=true and --SiftExtraction.domain_size_pooling=true. In addition, you should enable guided feature matching using: --SiftMatching.guided_matching=true. from here\nIt works but on extreme cases and at an enormous price, as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even use the GPU. So I ended up sticking with the \u0026ldquo;Standard\u0026rdquo; procedure. I also only use sequential matching as videos benefits a lot from such processing strategy.\nAn average reconstuction is done as following:\nConvert the video into a sequence of images Run COLMAP Enjoy (60% of the times) My goal is to improve the likelyhood of success.\n1. Image processing (Usually I deal with multiple cameras, that is why I heve the folder 00/ standing for the camera ID)\nFirst I create a folder and then run the following command. You can choose the FPS, experimentally I saw that 3 is the best, sometimes 2 is also good if the movement pace is slow (e.g. human walk) otherwise you can try 4 if there are holes in the reconstruction or errors, most of the times that should fix. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t try 5 but most likely you need to go to the previous step and reiterate there. (always talking for human walking velocity, if using bike or car, that is a whole differnt story)\n1 2 mkdir -p ./00/images ffmpeg -hwaccel auto -i ./video/GX010041.MP4 -vf \u0026#34;fps=4,scale=iw:ih\u0026#34; -q:v 8 ./00/images/%06d.png 2.

By breaking down the complex process into more manageable parts, I aimed to simplify and clarify the underlying mechanisms. In this post, I’ll share the insights and discoveries I’ve made along the way, shedding light on the essentials of Gaussian Splatting through the lens of my experience with Tinysplat.\nWhat is Gaussian Splatting? Gaussian splatting is a novel explicit surface representation developed to represent the 3D structure of an object or an environment and then convert (rasterize) them into 2D images to be shown on our screens.\nThe 2 most important pieces of this concept are: Gaussian and Splatting.\nGaussians Gaussians is a shorthand for Gaussian distribution, which we are familiar from statistics in 1 dimension. Hold tight because in this process the dimensions of the Gaussian distribution will go up to 2 and 3. The most intuitive way to think of a Gaussian in 3 dimensions (with a lot of abuse in notation) is to think about it as a balloon. Of this balloon we can control different proprieties such as the rotation, the color, the size, by inflating it more or less etc. Turns out that in the Gaussian Splatting process, we build the environment by merging together many of these balloons of different dimensions and colors at different positions in the space. Take a look at the following image:\nYou can think of a car being made of many balloons at different positions and different sizes and colors, but then you can observe this shape from many points and always understand that this is a car. And this brings us to the second key concept: splatting.\nSplatting Splatting is not a new concept and it refers to the technique of rendering each pixel on your monitor as the combination of many Gaussian-shaped \u0026ldquo;splats\u0026rdquo; (or balloons) by blending each contribution of each balloon given the camera position. You might wonder what is special about this technique. Well in a single words it is DIFFERENTIABLE. It means that we can run back-propagation to whatever loss we have and therefore manipulating the properties of every balloons in our scene. To some degree we can think of differentiability as being a human inside the room that can listen to our commands shouting from a small window telling him where he should move every balloon to create an object. Without differentiability we would not have a way to communicate to the person inside.\nImagine there is no \u0026ldquo;open window\u0026rdquo; and no way for the two guys to communicate. Then the process will be NON differentiable. It is exactly the communication that was the key to enable many interesting applications of Gaussian splatting. Remember \u0026ldquo;Communication is key\u0026rdquo;.\nBut why? Then you might ask why do we need to have a man inside a house inflating balloons and one guy outside observing and shouting?! Well that\u0026rsquo;s a fair question.\nIn proper terminology what this techniques enable is to learn from just a handful of images, on the order of the hundreds, a whole object or environment, so hopefully we can generate \u0026ldquo;novel views\u0026rdquo;. This fancy term refers basically that we can generate a rough 3D reconstruction from these images. Again in technical terms we are over-fitting a scene or also inferring from the images we have at our disposal, what would the image look like from a completely different point of view that we didn\u0026rsquo;t have before.\nIn conclusion this technique is called explicit neural radiance Field. The explicit term references the fact that the parameters of the Gaussians are stored as is, and in the weights as in the NeRF representation for example. Radiance field instead is just a fancy word that was chosen to describe the way that rays are captured by the camera coming from all the scene.\nOkay, balloons and communication, now what? This is a legit question. How do we even generate these Gaussians, and even how do we position them? We don\u0026rsquo;t have a human in the computer, let alone 2 people communicating!\nThe journey of creating a realistic scene is split into 2 parts:\nInitialization of the priors Fitting of the priors onto the images Priors initialization Gaussian splatting works better if we have already a rough idea of what the scene looks like. Imagine having some rough sketch of what you want, it is going to be easier to realize your masterpiece. In the same way, Gaussian Splatting works best when our initial sketch is a Point Cloud. A point cloud is exactly a way to define a rough sketch of the scene.\nThe most common way to obtain is to run an algorithm called Structure from Motion. In other words given images of the scene from different positions it will triangulate the points and create a 3D representation which is close enough to reality. These methods are still improving and there is no best approach but it depends on many factors such as dimensions, motions etc. In the end this is still an open research question, therefore many more options (hopefully) are coming every month.\nHere you can have a look of what that means. The red \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo; (camera frustums), represent the rotation and position of the cameras in space, whilst the points (which should be colored), they represent the 4D space that was reconstructed. It is called \u0026ldquo;sparse\u0026rdquo; reconstruction because as you might have noticed, it is missing a lot of points, but the 3D high level idea can be interpreted by a human at least.\nOnce this rough initialization has been created is time to go to next step.\nFitting of the Gaussians (more technical) This part is the most mindblowing and difficult, so take a deep breath and let\u0026rsquo;s dive into cold waters.\nNow that we have some images, the position and rotation of the cameras, where the image was taken and the priors point cloud, the real training begins.\nIt works very similar as in neural networks, where we have a set of parameters that needs to optimized using some gradient descent algorithm such as SGD. In this case all gaussians are initialized with the color and point in 3D space provided by the SfM algorithm. The scale and rotations are initialized as standard values such as 1.\nDuring training we use these values to create and project the Gaussians onto the screen in a differentiable manner. This will produce some strange images at first, by projecting all the gaussians to the screen that is orientated and positioned in the same way as the way the image was taken.\nThis way we have a reference of what the image should be at that position, and what we actually get from the \u0026ldquo;splatting\u0026rdquo; process. Now you might have understood already, we can calculate a loss or difference in similarity between the two images. There are 2 ways this difference is computed, and usually is a combination of different losses such as f1 loss, and SSIM loss, where $\\lambda$ is a parameter used to balance the two accuracies.\n$$ (1 - \\lambda) * \\text{F1-loss(img1, img2)} + \\lambda * \\text{SSIM(img1, img2)} $$\nIn this way iterating over the many images in the dataset, batch by batch, we can optimize the parameters of the whole number of Gaussians by backpropagating the error back to each gaussian based on the (sum) of the error(s) from every pixel in each image. By optimizing these parameters, after some epochs, a clear image can be seen. A 2D example is displayed below. What you see is a video of the training where the Gaussians gets progressively refined and the final result is a sharp and crisp image.\nYour browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a link to the video instead. (Video courtesy of OutOfAI)\nFinal thoughts This is a good introductory article to Gaussian splatting in a non-technical way. If you would like to dig deeper into the topics I am compiling a series of blog post where I show the implementation of Gaussian Splatting in 2D here and in the future also in 3D.\nI will leave another list of good material that helped me understand better the topic. Let me know if this was helpful, and especially how I can improve!\n","date":"2024-10-01T10:21:13+02:00","image":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/tiny-splat/tinysplat_small_hu11199495953070999910.jpg","permalink":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/tiny-splat/","title":"TinySplat"},{"content":"A BIG day in AI I woke up this morning and as usual, the fatigue to go running was there. I did and ran my 6.5k in around 33 minutes, a very good time and a bit unexpected. Days like this are a sign of a good day. Then while having breakfast with my favorite news platform namely x.com, I started seeing so many posts about Gemini 1.5. Then suddenly a lot of videos and tweets about some text-video model. I was confused. I was excited. OpenAI\u0026rsquo;s name was there, it must be something big I thought.\nWhen I started watching the first video I was shocked. I thought this was light years away. And there I was with my cereal bowl and the best AI-generated videos I have ever seen. I was very excited. At the same time I was also doubtful: \u0026ldquo;What am I studying for then\u0026rdquo;. Many things have been solved in AI already and this was a big step toward AGI, or as I would discover later to something else.\nSo, as much excited and doubtful as I was I went back to my desk and started studying Gradient Descent and learning rates. It was the right thing to do, but still, it was weird, that I felt I knew so little yet so much had been done. After the session, I went to lunch with my dear friends Alvaro and Hassan. We discussed about random stuff and passports.\nI started reading about this new model and the more video I was watching the more strange I was feeling. I saw some guy on the web doing already 3d reconstruction with such videos. I am working on the same topic. I had to try so I did.\nBut in the meanwhile the highlight of the day and surely of the year, was that the GOAT Yann Le Cun was visiting the campus here today. When I found that out the previous day, I was thrilled. I always looked up to him as an example and took so much inspiration from his talks and works. It was a unique moment of deep knowledge, critical thinking and first-principle reasoning. His insights were great and gave me hope for what I was thinking in the morning. My generation has the hope to still make an impact in the research field and hopefully as well for society and the world. The questions were not many as the time was limited, and only a handful stood out to me as new and thought-provoking.\nMy supervisor asked the question (that many are wondering) if academia can still compete with the industry in terms of research. The answer wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite clear, but the main point is that academia should challenge the industry with new ideas and most importantly propose new paradigms to solve the problems. The second clever question worth noting is about what are the pillars that are most likely unchanging in the future of AI. The answer comprised 4 main points: backpropagation, the gradient, the minimization of an objective and the GPU. The first three are needed for the learning itself, the latest is the bottleneck of the learning process. Another worth mentioning concept was the way he mentioned that the Transformer can answer any question, but it will always answer questions using the same amount of computation. This is how it is trained, and what it is supposed to do. But we don\u0026rsquo;t behave like this. If a question is harder we spend more computational power/time to come up with the correct answer. I was enthusiastic about this concept and I feel it is worth exploring more. These are some photos I was able to take with Yann Le Cun. The whole community was trying to get some photos and this is the best I could get.\n![A photo all together]A sneak peek of the talk](IMG_5686.jpg)![A closer selfie with the GOAT]I hope to see him in the future as he is a great scientist and engineer as he calls himself.\nAll in all the day went pretty well, I was able to finish the 3D Gaussian reconstruction I started earlier, which led me to do a video and post it on YouTube. I got also some comments from the video of the campus tour of the university and I was happy to see that people are interested in what we are doing here.\nThis is the result:\nI might do a video about how I did it, and it is just simple software used one after the other. The peculiarity here is that the video was generated by an AI model, with emergent 3D capabilities. In other words, the 3D information was consistent throughout the video, and this is a big step toward the future of AI-generated videos. This was also proved by the good even if not perfect results I got from the 3D reconstruction.\n","date":"2024-02-16T10:21:13+02:00","image":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/big-day-inai/cover_hu8811311259417943632.jpg","permalink":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/big-day-inai/","title":"A BIG day in AI"},{"content":"What is \u0026ldquo;chatGPT\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t think chatGPT needs much of an introduction. It entered in our lives in late November and it is not going to go away for a long while now. It allows user to write some prompts and get a Natural Language model to answer in any language an to pretty much any question that he get posed.\nIn one way or another, most of us has come into contact with this \u0026ldquo;AI\u0026rdquo; Fanta scientific technology coming from the future. This is the trajectory we are going to follow for the next years. If there are 20 \u0026ldquo;Megatrends\u0026rdquo; well AI is going to lead them all.\nBut enough with speculations, I wanted to share my thoughts on the ethic of using such tools in every day life and where might the boundaries be, from using it to sharpen our knowledge or to fake being smart and pretend to be someone else.\nTherefore I asked to the direct interested one. ChatGPT.\nThe input \u0026ldquo;Is it ethical for a student to use chatGPT, in order to write faster motivational letters, and draft of emails in order to save time to concentrate more on other creative stuff, research and in general other more interesting stuff, given that is not counterproductive? Another example would be to write a motivational letter to enter a course in which he has a lot of interest but too many things to do for preparing a well written and professional text\u0026rdquo;\nThe answer It is ultimately up to the individual to decide whether using a tool like ChatGPT to write motivational letters or emails is ethical. However, it is important to consider the potential consequences of using such a tool. If the student\u0026rsquo;s use of ChatGPT results in a letter or email that is not their own work and does not accurately reflect their own thoughts and writing abilities, it could be considered plagiarism and may lead to disciplinary action. Additionally, if the student relies too heavily on ChatGPT and does not put in the effort to improve their own writing skills, they may not be adequately prepared for future academic or professional writing tasks. Ultimately, it\u0026rsquo;s best to use these tools as a tool to help you and not a replacement of your own efforts and skills.\nWell The answer is sharp and concise.\nIf the student\u0026rsquo;s use of ChatGPT results in a letter or email that is not their own work and does not accurately reflect their own thoughts and writing abilities, it could be considered plagiarism and may lead to disciplinary action.\nThis short phrase, collects all my thoughts and showcase them in the most brilliant form. The reflection of our own abilities can really be seen in a text, but mostly our actions and things we did and that we take as ours.\nWhat my grandmother thinks I have talked about this tool with my grandmother and as always when I talk about technology she feels far away from this witchcrafts. She said something interesting thought that can be taken as a starting point of some thoughts flow. She said and I quote:\nEverything great is done by people, just like you and if you want to do something great it has to come from yourself.\nShe is literally afraid of what technology can do even if she acknowledges what good has been brought by innovations. Having said that she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to have to do with such things, she is too old to learn.\nFinally me In the end I don\u0026rsquo;t have any answer in this world, yet(?), but something I can tell for sure. If the goal is to go from A to B, you might decide to get by bike, by foot or even by car. I think is ultimately up to us to choose the method in which we reach any goal. Surely it has to be consistent to our thoughts, and just because we have a car and therefore we can visit all the places in a year that will take a lifetime to do by foot, means we are better off. We just had a different journey, maybe it was even worst then the second person\u0026rsquo;s one. I hope you can see the analogy here.\nThe goal and the end of a person has to stay the same, with time this tool will allow to get there, with less risks, maybe even faster and with some different path. Ultimately is the goal we reach that fulfil ourselves and the journey we took there, definitely not the tools used.\nIf we can learn during the process, always be integrity with ourselves and never faking our abilities and accomplishments, it will become irrelevant which tools are we using and why.\nI am no Oracle This is how I came to think now, but I am very curios about other\u0026rsquo;s prospective and ideas. Let\u0026rsquo;s create a healthy discussion in the comments.\n","date":"2023-01-25T10:21:13+02:00","image":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/chatgpt/cover_hu8929779238658280223.jpg","permalink":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/chatgpt/","title":"ChatGPT"},{"content":"For a biscuit It was late October and during a lesson of entrepreneurship and innovation the class moved outside to take a picture with the guest lecturer from the company \u0026ldquo;Dr. Schär\u0026rdquo;. He told us about his personal story and his business.\nI was walking out the building and I casually met a person, who offered me a biscuit and we just started chatting about how the seminar went and why we were there. We spent more than an hour chatting around in the cold and under the rain, so I had to take the later bus. But it was worth it all the way.\nWhy a hackathon Julian and I kept in touch, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t until the hackathon of November that we met in person and went off with two different teams. In that occasion I brought what seemed to be some cutting edge technology: The oculus quest 2. My team won the hackathon and both me and Julian were thrilled by the prospective opportunities that this technology promised.\nA couple week after he told to me about a long forgotten project about videogames for the world war 1 in the Dolomites. I was over the top: the technology hyped me, the victory from the hackathon gave me so much confidence and the fact that a good bunch of money was involved was all I could see at that time. So I accepted, and the rest is history.\nHistory? We proposed the project to the enterpreneur and he was more than stunned to see what this technology would enable and the (at the time) limitless possibilities of this piece of hardware. Off we went, after a couple weeks we got an offer and without esitations and no experience whatsoever we took the plunge. We were able to get all the burocracy done with the help of some friends and we were ready to show the world what we were capable of and to start a multi-billion euro company.\nWell not exactly That\u0026rsquo;s all about the heroic and cool part. We didn\u0026rsquo;t have any experience, no computing hardware that was capable of doing anything near what we promised. And our skills were limited to what I and him learned in the University.\nWe had to learn everything and do all from scratch. And that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what we did. I got a new Gaming computer, set up everything, and in doing so I asked a friend for advice and he ended up joining us. We were now 3 undergraduates just trying to pull off a mission.\nThe plan I came back from Erasmus around August and the plan was to start from the 1st September and work until December, every day for 8 hours, 4 days a week. How long did we last? Less than a song.\nWe started strong but in the end I felt overwehlmed by the work as I put everything from my health, people to my wellbeing aside. I wanted this to be the most important thing in the next 6 months. I didn\u0026rsquo;t study German, and eventually I failed on it. I didn\u0026rsquo;t persue anything else than just working tirelessly. I was heading directly towards the valley of burnout. It was around October, nearly a year later, when most of us had resized the time allowed for this work that I found myself obsessing over something I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have. I am used to work many hours a day. But when it is for something I really care and I see my team working as me as well it is when I am pushed to my best and even further. In such a way I do grow.\nIt was not about the team: we were having good interactions, I learned to work in a group project as I did not during my university years, I learned new skills, learned how to manage a big project and retarget the plan once in a while. It was indeed an experience that improved me, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t see myself growing in the right direction. And this insight was not clear from the beginning. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t see anything that made me grow as a person.\nIt was clear that my head was clashing against my actions, actions made towards a project that I long searched and thrived for.\nThe pain The pain arrived from more sides. I was literally sorrounded. I started lifting weights and going to the gym regularly every day since mid October, that has been my saving. The pain was still there but I learned to manage the physical one. The worst was indeed the mental pain. It was for me way harder to manage, because I was not used to it and didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to handle it properly.\nSo, as always when I don\u0026rsquo;t know what to do, I seek advice from books, the masters of time. I started reading, I started journaling, I started going around with a backpack filled with weights in order to feel other pain, the more manageable one.\nNovember came and I remember it as the thoughest month of the year 2022. From the first day to the very last. But if I look back now, it was the most insightful and it teached me the most. I was also going through some kind of relationship problems and that drained much of my mental energy. I started overthinking and I can feel the effects of it still now.\nHow does this all relate? Well the insights from that month, really stood strong and gave me direction on how to come out this lonely, heavy and fearful state of mind. Because everything is in our mind, if you want it or not. Two facts really stood by me:\nStart planning your life from the end How much would you do to have it if you did not The first resonates with me because I finally felt, and I was able to admit to myself, that I was going down the wrong path. There is nothing wrong with making such videogames and this career path. But at the end of my life I just didn\u0026rsquo;t want to be remembered as such figure.\nThe second instead, taught me some hard lessons about work, love and life. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t have this position, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have done much to get into it. I was finally able to explain the situation. Also it taught me about love and what I had lost, it pushed me to try to get it back if I ever will. Because this shows how much I would have been doing, if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have it.\nTo be continued\u0026hellip; If you would like to find out how it did end, well you might have to wait some time, because we missed the deadline and we are still working on it.\nSTAY TUNED\nP.S. let me know if you liked this personal stories and what would you like to develop more\n","date":"2023-01-21T14:31:13+02:00","image":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/realverse/cover_hu12121328656837555668.jpg","permalink":"https://sebo-the-tramp.github.io/p/realverse/","title":"Realverse"},{"content":"The Boiling Frog: An Analogy for Climate Change The story of the boiling frog is a well-known analogy for the gradual and insidious nature of change. The tale goes that if a frog is placed in a pot of boiling water, it will immediately jump out to safety. However, if a frog is placed in a pot of cool water that is slowly heated, it will not notice the change and eventually be boiled to death.\nNow This analogy can be applied to the current situation of climate change. The Earth\u0026rsquo;s temperature is slowly and steadily rising, and many people are not taking notice or taking action. Just like the frog in the pot, we are becoming accustomed to the gradual changes and not realizing the danger we are in.\nHow Climate change is caused by human activity, primarily the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These actions release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising the Earth\u0026rsquo;s temperature. The effects of climate change are already being felt around the world, from rising sea levels and more intense storms, to droughts and wildfires.\nDenial Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence of the reality and seriousness of climate change, there is still a significant portion of the population that denies or downplays the issue. This lack of action and denial can have dire consequences for future generations.\nSo The question remains, will we, as a society, take the necessary steps to reduce our carbon footprint and slow down climate change before it\u0026rsquo;s too late? Or will we, like the frog in the pot, be boiled to death by our own inaction?\nThen?

I thought it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too hard to come up with one, since I have so many thoughts and I am creative. That, sadly, didn\u0026rsquo;t happen. I turned then to a quote by Elon Musk, just to close and send the form I was filling. It was \u0026ldquo;Solve climate change or die trying\u0026rdquo;. I soon realized that it didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like mine but I sent the quote anyway because I had spent too much time on this.
